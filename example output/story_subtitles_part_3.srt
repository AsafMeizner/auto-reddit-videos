much

56
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:17,780
more

me

62
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,460
to

63
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,780
consider

64
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,140
taking

65
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,339
our

66
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:20,620

73
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,460
reasoning

74
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:23,760
is

75
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:23,940
that

76
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,160
both

77
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,379

close

81
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,600
so

82
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:25,739
we

83
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:25,879

that

90
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:27,660
she

91
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,000
doesn't

92
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,199
want

93
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,399

115
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,159
it's

116
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,600
