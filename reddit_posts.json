She said hang on and unzipped her pants. Sat down on the toilet.\nI thought she had to pee. Then she grunted. I heard a fart. Then a plop.\nI unlocked the door and ran. Never saw her again."

        "text": "So, about 3 weeks ago I flew to South Korea for a vacation with friends who live there. My husband didn't want to go and said he'd be fine staying home and watching the house and dog. I trusted him because he's a 40 year old adult man and assumed he'd be able to feed himself like a sane person despite him possessing the cooking ability of a cactus. I was wrong. I should've dragged him and the dog along with me to another country.\nWhat my husband decided to do during his 3 weeks without me was absurd. I would've been happier if he'd cheated on me instead. Because what he did was: order nothing but Taco Bell through DoorDash after he: somehow broke my stove by: cooking an entire 15lbs bag of red lentils all at once. Then he didn't bother to get a bowl for his lentils, he just ate them straight from the pot and stuffed the pot into the fridge and broke one of the shelves inside it. Now realizing his mistake, he decided to order nothing but terrible tacos for the remaining 2 weeks while getting high on medical marijuana. Also for some reason he bought a bunch of honeycombs from one of our friend's fathers and decided those made a good snack and has eaten nothing but beeswax and honey for the last few days because he's some kind of weird alien in a human disguise. Apparently honeycombs give you gas. And lentils give you gas. And Taco Bell gives you gas.\nSo now it's today and I'm awoken by what sounds like someone revving a motorcycle in my bedroom followed by the stench of the fiery pits of hell itself. It's 5:30 in the morning. He gets up and goes to use the toilet as I'm opening the windows in a poor attempt to ventilate the house but it's too late. He doesn't even have a solid poop, it's just 10 minutes of gas. Like 20 seconds of nonstop farts followed by a huge gasp of air and then another 20 seconds of gas. By this time, the dog has hidden under my couch because it doesn't know what those loud honking noises are and fears for its safety. I consider joining it, but continue to open every window in my house. It's 62 degrees out and windy. The wind just blows the fart smell around the house. My husband has left the bathroom and has walked upstairs. It sounds like there's a small 2-stroke engine in his pants.\nI can't take it anymore and scream that I'm going to get breakfast at the diner and leave him. I bring the dog with me because the dog follows me out of the house because it also doesn't want to be here right now. So now I'm at the diner waiting for my husband to de-gas himself while the dog sits underneath the table next to me wearing a pink leash-kid harness that my friends bought for me as a gag gift that has my name and \"Emotional Support Human\" on it that the waitress thought was some kind of in-joke.\nThis is the start of my morning. I hope it's not as stinky as yours."

        "text": "Well, a couple of weeks ago I found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago, the way I found out is that her sister told me after going to visit her to find out how the delivery of her first child was, she confessed to me that 6 years ago my wife told her that she slept drunk with her best friend, in her words, my wife was very sorry.\nAt the time she told me I was with my \"son\" and immediately after leaving her house I went to take a paternity test with him, fearing the worst.\nA week later I get the results and my fears came true, my son is not mine, for some reason, I began to see the boy differently, more as an acquaintance than a son, with proofs in hand I confronted my wife at night when the child was sleeping, she asked me who told me and I simply told her that it is none of her business, although obviously it will not take long to connect the dots that it was her sister, well, that is not my problem now.\nRegardless of that, I asked her for a divorce, which is now in process, she was \"devastated\", she swore to me more than once that nothing happened with anyone again, that she has been faithful to me in body and soul since then, I held back the urge to insult her to avoid complications during the divorce issue, not believing a word she said, mostly blaming the alcohol instead of taking the blame herself.\nAfter talking about it, she threatened me saying that she would demand full custody of the child, I was so annoyed at that moment that I told her okay, I don't want anything to do with something that is not mine, that she keep the child and I'll keep the dogs (we have two dogs that we adopted as puppies and they are currently 8 years old each) after my words she tried to convince me to take care of the child with her, that I am his father, at that moment I exploded, I was so angry and I had held back so much the urge to scream that I just yelled her to go and take her bastard with her.\nA week has passed since that and I am at home (it is in my name because it is a gift from my parents), she went to her parents' house with her kid, she has not called me since then, she left with everything and the half-asleep kid when I yelled at her, especially since it was the first time I really yelled at her, it sure affected her.\nI talked to my parents and my dad told me that I did the right thing and that I shouldn't be raising something that is not of my blood, and I agree with him, however, the pain is still there, my younger brother told me to write here to entertain myself, I am currently seeing a therapist 3 times a week, who told me that I have already taken the first step, which was to leave behind what causes me pain, it just hurts to know that my family no longer exists.\nRegarding why my sister-in-law told me everything, according to her, she felt guilty seeing me always happy with my son, knowing that he may not be mine, and that the fact that we went to visit her in a moment of weakness caused her to completely break down with guilt, I don't know how true that is, I just know that right now I feel tremendous hatred for my wife and a feeling between pain and resentment for the child, although it's just time to get ahead.\nI just hope the divorce goes smoothly, we have separate financers and properties and if she really asks for child support I have proof that it's not mine, according to my lawyer that's more than enough if she tries a legal process for that, my therapist also recommended that I not see him nor her, that regardless of the child's feelings, I should focus on my own first, that the child is no longer my problem and the sooner I accept it, the better.\nSorry for the misspellings, English is not my first language."

I’ve been seeing my therapist for about a year, and he specializes in eating disorders, which is something I've struggled with for a long time. Over time, our sessions became more personal and emotional.\nIt started with longer eye contact and his comforting touch on my shoulder. After one particularly intense session, he hugged me for a little too long. The line began to blur, and I started to develop feelings for him. One evening, after a deeply personal conversation about my progress and how I wish I had someone to celebrate with, he invited me to grab some drinks. I thought it was just him being kind and supportive, but in the back of my head I honestly hoped he'd confirm having similar feelings that I'd been having.\nWe sat closer than usual, at one point he even reached out to hold my hand. I could feel the tension between us. He complimented my progress and told me how proud he was of me. That's honestly what sent me even further into this intense feeling of lust. His words were soothing, and before I knew it, we were kissing. It felt surreal, like a dream. One thing led to another, and we ended up going back to his place and sleeping together. I know it was a huge ethical breach, and now I’m struggling with my emotions. I’m terrified of the consequences and that I now need to look for a different therapist. I'm never good at starting over.. idk what i'm going to do, I just needed to tell someone."

But 2 days after she came home, she was experiencing exhaustion, pain in her body, and she constantly fainting.

I can't stop crying and thinking that if the doctors had noticed that something was wrong, my sister could still be alive.\nI loved my sister to death. She was my role model growing up.

I decided to surprise her with taylor swift concert tickets, since i knew she really wanted to go. I called in sick the day the tickets dropped and waited in the ticket master cue for 2 hours. finally when it opened up, i bought two seats, for 400 dollars each, presumably one for her, and another for me. When she came back from work that night i surprised her with the tickets, and she was ecstatic. However, when I claimed i was excited to go with her, she got very confused and claimed she thought the two tickets were for her and her best friend, (who is also a big Taylor swift fan). I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs. Like i said before i also believed this would be a memory we could both remember together. Should I have done things differently and not given up my ticket so willingly?"

(Disclaimer, English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry for all the spelling/grammar mistakes)\nMe [F18] had just gotten in a relationship with my new sweet boyfriend [M20]. A little info about me. I have a chronic stomach wound which pops up whenever I'm really stressed.\nThe relationship was very new so we were both still quite shy, we had just gotten comfortable enough farting in front of each other tho, and often made a joke out of it. About a month into our relationship I had to go to the hospital with my stomach wound, I was there for a week and he was super supportive the whole time. When I finally got home from the hospital my body was so weak, I wasn't allowed to drink or eat anything the whole week because of the tests they had to make. Therefore my body had pretty much shut down, nothing had come in, so nothing came out. I got prescribed some laxatives that I took, never having taken them before I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't this! We were laying in bed, I was on my side looking at my phone, and he was half sitting up in bed playing RuneScape on his laptop in front of me. I could feel a fart coming, so I looked up into his eyes with a smirk face expression and said: \"I'm shitting!\"\nI meant to say \"I'm farting\" but the words came out wrong.. and so did something else. The moment I said it, I let it all out, still with a smirk face expression looking him right in the eyes. You could hear a wet bubbly sound, and I instantly knew what had happened. My smile fated and my face turned to horror, my hand flew down to stop the flow but it was too late. Boyfriend jumped up and ran to the toilet to bring me paper, he helped me clean up while just laughing hysterically, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even say anything.\nLater when we sat and talked he told me that it was the most intimidating thing he had ever experienced, the way I looked right into his eyes, he had never felt so dominated in his life. \"Like a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it\". Needless to say we got very quickly comfortable with intimate things like that after this. Even tho we've broken up since then and it's been a few years, I'm to this day still just as embarrassed."

I told her I’ve been sleeping with 1 other women consistently and this drove her absolutely insane - like I genuinely thought she was going to do someone rash, like slash my tires or something. But no, she just screamed at me and demanded to know who she was. She went on to say she only cheated once and she was completely inebriated when it happened as if that someone absolves her of any wrongdoing. The audacity.\nwell anyways, I broke up with her and threw her out of my house. I then proceeded to invite the boys over for some bbq. All in all, it was a hilarious experience.

Not too often to be annoying, but often enough that she knew my rule.\nThen one day, later in the school year (it may even have been when she was in 1st grade) as I was getting ready to drop her off at school, once again I said to her \"remember now, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old\".\nThis time she had a totally different reply.\nShe turned to me, and looked right at me with those eyes that she could use to get whatever she wanted from her dad, and said \"Well, if I get good grades all through school and college, can I start dating when I am 29\"?\nIt took all the willpower I had to not smile and start laughing when she asked that. With a very serious look on my face, I showed her that I was taking a moment to consider what she had just asked.\nThen I replied to her \"Hmmm.....Well okay, you've got a deal. If you get good grades all through school and college I will let you start dating at 29\".\nShe replied, \"okay daddy\", got out of the car, and bounced her way on into school for the day.\nFor those who are going to ask, yes she waited till she was 29 to start dating, because she always followed daddy's rules.\nJust kidding.\nShe had her first boyfriend at around 13 years old, breaking her Daddy's heart."

We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of 15 concrete steps.\nIt was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go \"Oh god\" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.\nI freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.\nThe ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR\nI feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.\nHe was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.\nI don't really know why I'm writing all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.\nEDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction.

My whole life, I'd thought I was a lesbian, and then I developed feelings for a guy. Everything I knew was wrong. I tried distancing myself from him in hopes the feelings would go away, but they didn't. I kept thinking about him, and I eventually gave in and asked him out. Once I convinced him that I wasn't joking, he accepted, and we started dating.\nDating him wasn't that different than dating a girl. The sex was so weird, but he was so accommodating. The first couple of times, he made sure I was comfortable and he was so careful and gentle. The thought of me with any other guy still grosses me out, but being with my boyfriend makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.

I surprised him with a pregnancy test result that we will be having a 5th child. He seemed to have a meltdown when he heard it and he said no, it is impossible, we have been careful. I thought he would be happy as he said it himself when we were dating that he wants a lot of kids. I calmed him down somehow... Yesterday, I went with my husband to the gynecologist to have my sonogram and the doctor says I am 10 weeks pregnant and we are having twins. My husband was livid. He keeps screaming no no no no no. I lost count of him saying no. After his meltdown at doctors office he told me that he just can't have 6 kids at his age. I got confused as what he is saying- as I know he wanted a big family. he wanted it himself. I cried and told him what are we supposed to do and he keep saying that he just can't have 6 kids. On our way home he says how he should not have gotten married and have kids and he does not know anymore if his life is worth it, that he'd be happy to have a reset button. I got so mad I told him that it takes two to tango, that creating a kid is not just my fault. Today I woke up with screaming and crying kids begging their father to not go. Turns out he already packed and ready to go. My 3 year old is hugging his fathers luggage and crying and his face is stoic. By then I knew I was stupid to committing a mistake of marrying him. It maybe hard as I am pregnant right now, but I got a full time job and we do have a nanny and supportive family and friends. It is best if he go, I do not need another baby to take care of. So, to my dear soon to be ex-husband Jerry, F*CK YOU. don't come back."

We call my husband \"Bucky\" because he resembles the character from the MCU movies. My Bucky is a bit more yummy.\nYesterday was the first time we had dinner with his family since the wedding. My sister-in-law (F20) is my favorite person besides my husband, which is why she was my Maid of Honor. She took me aside and told me what happened behind the scenes at my wedding.\nA bit of background first: My mother-in-law (F48) never liked me, and she didn't hide it from me, though she did hide it from her son. This started from the moment we began dating. She would play nice in front of him but make nasty comments as soon as he was out of sight. At first, I didn't say anything to Bucky, hoping that, in time, his mother would warm up to me. But it never stopped. Eventually, I had enough and started telling Bucky.\nBucky spoke with his mother, but she claimed I was misunderstanding her. She didn't stop; she just became subtler, saying things that could be interpreted in multiple ways. I don't blame Bucky, he did believe me, but he also believed his mother when she said she meant something else.\nWhen Bucky proposed, I thought that would be the end of it, but she only got sneakier. I almost called off the wedding because I couldn't handle it anymore. We had arguments, and it was frustrating. Bucky always believed me but didn’t believe it was his mother’s intent to be hurtful. Somehow, we got through it and started planning the wedding.\nMy sister-in-law helped with the wedding planning and preparations, and because my mother-in-law was minimally involved, everything was perfect.\nFrom my perspective, everything went as planned on the wedding day, though we started a bit later. Bucky told me it couldn't be avoided because something important came up last minute. I assumed it was work-related, so I didn’t ask.\nBut now I've heard from my sister-in-law what actually happened. I was in the bridal suite, so I didn’t see or hear any of this.\nMy mother-in-law arrived at the venue wearing white. When Bucky found out, he asked my sister-in-law to bring her to his ready room, along with his other siblings and father.\nWhen my mother-in-law walked in and tried to hug him, Bucky stopped her. He asked what she was wearing, and when she dismissed it, he repeated the question differently: Why was she wearing white at his wedding? Why was she trying to hurt his soon-to-be wife? Why was she trying to ruin his wedding day?\nI think phrasing it as his day rather than my day got to his mother. He reminded her that it was his wedding too. She still tried to dismiss it, saying he was overreacting and it was just a dress.\nThat’s when he lost it. He started yelling at his mother, saying that he now realized I wasn't misunderstanding her—she was deliberately being hurtful to me. He yelled that he had been defending her to me all this time, but now it was clear that I was the one who needed defending. He accused his mother of trying to sabotage his relationship. When my father-in-law tried to say something, Bucky shut him down, saying he didn't want to hear it because they had stood by and enabled her behavior.\nBucky then told his mother, \"Because you're my mother, I'm willing to postpone the wedding by half an hour to give you a chance to change. I don't care if you go home, to a store, or wherever. Just leave now and only come back when you've changed. If you refuse, you will never see me, my wife, or our future children ever again. Do I make myself clear?\"\nThe wedding was perfect, and my mother-in-law wore a blue dress.\nI don't know how to thank this man enough. His birthday is in three months, and I’m going to have to plan something extra special.\nAn update"

        "text": "Last week while my wife (49F) was taking a shower I (50M) saw a notification pop up on her phone and went to open it thinking it was one of our daughter’s (Maddy 24F and Alice 26F) confirming what time their girl’s dinner was.\nInstead I saw an unsaved number saying “I can’t wait to see you!” And then kissing emoji. I froze for a second. I clicked on the message and saw a short thread mostly confirming dinner plans for that evening and how they missed each other and once a week just wasn’t enough. I knew what I saw. 29 years of marriage down the drain.\nHoping to catch her in a lie before she left the house, I texted both our daughters and asked them about girls dinner. What happened next broke me to my core. Both girls confirmed the dinner and said they were excited. I couldn’t believe it.\nNot proud of what came next. I turned her location sharing on with me in her phone and let her leave. I followed her to a restaurant and lo and behold neither daughter was there but instead a man I knew was her boss. I was so heartbroken. Part of me was hoping I was just a paranoid freak and my daughters would be there happy to see me! But no, just my cheating wife and her AP. I took pictures of the two of them holding hands, and kissing. I know I should have waited but I couldn’t help myself, I was so angry. As soon as I got in my car, I opened the group chat we had as a family, sent them all the photos and said “Glad you’re enjoying girls dinner together!”\nI then turned my phone off and drove to my brothers house and asked to stay the night. I woke up the next morning to over 40 texts and 20 voicemails.\nMy wife went through the cheaters playbook of excuses. I didn’t even listen to her voicemails. I was about to respond with: “I will be getting a divorce, I recommend a lawyer.” But my brother stopped me. He told me to meet with a bunch of lawyers first and make sure she couldn’t use them.\nInstead I just sent the group chat a simple message: “I am physically fine, but need time. I will come home when I’m ready.” I then muted my phone.\nI called different lawyers that looked to be the best in town that morning for appointments. Met with all of them, and picked the one who looked ready to treat this as scorched earth as possible.\nFinally after spending all day with lawyers, I looked through the messages and both my daughters were apologizing. My younger daughter, the daddy’s girl of the two, was manic. She had texted me almost 50 times saying she never should have lied and hated it every time. Her boyfriend even reached out asking me to please reach out to her, that he didn’t know what was going on but that she was on the verge of a panic attack.\n“Maddy, I love you but please understand that what you’ve done has hurt me deeply, I need you to give me space.”\nI sent it and within seconds got a “okay, I’m so sorry, I never should have helped, I’ll never forgive myself. I love you too.”\nI didn’t respond. Alice was different. We always had a good relationship but she was a momma’s girl through and through. She said she was sorry but that I shouldn’t throw away a good marriage because of one mistake. This made me furious.\n“Alice, this isn’t a mistake, this is a betrayal. From my whole family. Please don’t reach out again until I make first contact.”\nShe never responded but I know she showed it to me STBX because she started saying that I shouldn’t take this out on Alice. I never responded. I’ll never talk to her again except through lawyers.\nThis all happened 5 days ago. I’m still at my brothers and can’t contain my feelings. I cry every morning and most of the day. I oscillate between complete dipilitating sadness and all-consuming anger. Losing my wife will be hard enough but how do I ever look at my children again? How do I even begin to forgive them? Alice is supposed to get married in the fall, I’ve been paying for almost everything, now I’m probably not going to go.\nI don’t even know how to move forward. I am completely destroyed.\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/csLL5xrC4x"

        "text": "It sounds unbelievable, but that’s exactly what happened. Just before the interview, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom but hoped I could hold it for the 10 minutes before the interview. I was mistaken. I had a severe stomach issue and ended up having a bowel movement right before the interview. I cleaned myself up quickly and joined the call, but I was still dealing with the aftermath.\nDuring the interview with the COO, I could hear my stomach making loud noises, and I was sweating from the discomfort. I hoped it would end quickly, but the COO kept asking questions. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and soiled myself during the interview.\nDespite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at that point. I ended the call, had to replace my chair, and will likely share this story with my grandchildren in the future. It was a terrible experience but ended with an incredible outcome."

SIL is incredibly gullible and believes literally anything she reads on the internet. Well she read that if you give yourself an enema with coffee it can help cleanse toxins from your body (cue collective eye roll). BIL comes home one day to a scary looking mess in the bathroom; what appears to be blood soaked pads, towels, etc. BIL freaks out and immediately begins asking SIL what happened and if she’s okay. SIL gets very cagey and avoidant of his questions. BIL continues panicking thinking something is incredibly wrong and SIL needs to go to the ER. Finally, BIL gets her to spill. After reading on the internet that it is healthy and beneficial to give yourself and enema with coffee she decided to try it! Only she missed one very important step in letting your coffee cool down first before you try to insert it into your asshole. So SIL gave herself and unsuccessful enema with hot coffee and literally burned her rectum. She refused to go to the doctor out of embarrassment. This is my favorite story that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing in my life and now it gets to grace Reddit as well\n***edited to add BIL in this post is SILs husband, sorry for the confusion I should have written that part better. SIL reluctantly relayed this story to my husband (her brother) at great urging from her husband\nEdit: this happened months ago and as far as I know SIL has not suffered any side effects from this. We are no longer on speaking terms due to how she decided to treat my husband, my mother in law (her mother), and myself. It was not actually blood on the towels and pads but a coffee/poo mixture."

        "text": "I (36 m) have been with my wife (35f) for 17 years. We have 3 children together. I was always of the mindset that I wanted monogamy in life, one woman to come home to and that id be with for the long haul. I had women try to talk to me over the years but I never pursued it because I was completely content in my marriage, my wife was my dream girl and i never wanted to hurt her. Over the years there was 2 occasions where I discovered she was being unfaithful in our marriage. One was an off and on again affair that lasted a few years with her married coworker & the other was a fling with an ex she'd dated in high school when she went to visit her family states away.\nI'm sure there will be people who say I am stupid which looking back I can't even deny myself but, after a period of seperation with both situations I decided to forgive my wife as I never wanted to raise my children in a broken home like I had been and i really felt like we could make it through it. We were young whenever the situation with her coworker happened so I chalked it up to being young and making dumb choices without thinking.\nFor a while things were seemingly okay, I never fully trusted her but I tried my best to push back my doubts because I knew if I decided to forgive her then I had to do my best to move past it and have a clean slate. It's been 4 years since the 2nd time she'd been unfaithful & I felt like I made the right decision by letting her have that chance to show she still wanted to be in our marriage. She was a different person for years and we were happy and even had various things set in motion for the future of our family. However, 2 months ago my reality was once again shattered by yet another incident which in my mind was by far worse than the others.\nI ended up receiving a message from one of my best friends wives. This friend knew my wife a little, he'd met her in passing but it wasn't like we all hung out together or anything like that for me to even worry about them. We worked together so there was some times my wife would bring him up multiple times while we were talking about work, she would bring me coffee to work and also one for him. I noticed when she did she'd dress in more revealing clothing than she usually wore but i never commented on it. She even convinced me that we should buy him a joint birthday present & take him out for drinks on his birthday. Just little things like that which were obviously weird but like I said I didn't think I had anything to worry about with either of them. To my knowledge he had a good marriage with his wife, he never spoke badly about it so i didnt think hed have any interest either. Not to mention we we'd actually been friends for a very long time and i trusted him. I'd make comments in a joking way to my wife about how she took too much of an interest in him and she laughed it off saying she just wanted to have another couple to be friends with.(she never actually tried to plan anything as far as to hang out with him and his wife as a couple) I agreed they would be good to be friends with so again I never thought too much into the overly friendliness of my wife with him. Turns out I was way wrong not to because I was met with multiple screenshots implying they were engaged in a full out affair. I wanted to get my proof situated before I ended up confronting my wife because I didn't want her to have the opportunity to manipulate the situation or try to lie her way out of it. So I started to go through call logs, credit statements etc. Because I didn't know how far this actually went past the social media screenshots I saw.\nWhen the truth came out, neither of them tried to lie to me about it. I found out they were sneaking off to hotels when she was supposed to be doing doubles at work and he was supposed to be off with family. And that my friend would leave work to go see her at her job basically every day for a month & she'd meet up with him on his lunch breaks. They were even planning a weekend at a hotel for the next weekend before the truth came out. I obviously cut ties with my friend and honestly I have no idea what to do about my situation with my wife. Their affair ended and my wife apologized profusely saying she just got carried away. She said that she'd felt lacking in our marriage with both of us dedicating so much time to work/other things and that my friend was there and a \"nice guy\", she said she let herself envy the way he treated his wife and wished she could've had that with me but was afraid to tell me i wasnt doing enough in our marriage. So in her words, she made a mistake and that she didn't know how to end it once it started.\nFor now we are living in the same house because realistically neither of us have the means to leave right now as her family doesn't live here plus the costs of renting and houses here are absurd and on top of that we still have our children in our house who are all still in school. She is basically trying to do anything to keep me around including telling me I can see women casually outside of our marriage as long as i come home to her she would never hold it against me as cheating. I told her that's not much of a marriage & it's certainly not anything I ever set out to have but she is hellbent on keeping our family together by any means. She's even brought up how we shouldn't let our kids live in a broken home because of our marital issues.\nI guess my wife is under the impression that nothing could make me want out of this marriage and that by offering things like that she thinks will fix our marriage. I guess in a way that is my fault for letting so much slide in the past. I do love her in some ways but at this point I think the love is more just from the fact we have kids together & that I've been with her for nearly 2 decades rather than feelings of being in love. My self confidence is low and my wife is out of my league but still i dont think that's enough of a reason to stay. She claims she loves me and doesn't want to loose all we've built and are building toward but to me I just can't see how that can be true when she was so okay with running around with one of my only friends. I can't trust her, to me her word is meaningless, I forgive her then how long until she goes and does it again? I do think people can make mistakes & be forgiven because people are flawed, but this isn't just one slip up. And truth be told my faith in her is so low I don't even know if there's been more instances on top of the ones I actually know about. My mental state is essentially a puddle of mud right now.\nI'm sure there's probably someone reading this calling me a dumbass and I can't even argue that but yeah basically my life is a shit show and I don't know how to proceed\nedit; I'm not staying with my wife i should have clarified that better. Me saying I don't know how to proceed is more talking about how to go about handling this with my children, I've never dealt with anything legal so the stress of having to meet with lawyers and also not knowing how to go about our living situation. I have enough proof that my wife couldn't flip the switch and take everything from me but as a guy that's always something you have to worry about. Thankyou for your words, and some of you saying I'm a dumbass- trust me I know, can't change that now unfortunately. Just have to keep moving forward."

I had my suspicions when we first had our son, we decided that it was best I become a stay at home dad while she worked as she had made so much more money than I did as she was a general manager. First she started saying things like she had to go to work parties as it was mandatory or she’d be fired or she was staying late at work because people had called off and it was busy. One day she had come on to me being very flirty and persuading me To have sex with her. Now that I look back I think she was already pregnant at this point and wanted it to look like I had gotten her knocked up. Of course like any man would I fucked her and came inside. About a month later she was telling me she was pregnant, I was cool with it why not. When it came down to having our second son I noticed that about a year into it, he looked nothing like me or my wife, keep in mind we are both WHITE, I have blond hair and brown eyes, my skin is super pale and my wife is just almost the same. This kid the more he grew was really dark skinned Mexican hair and looked like one of the guys you’d see from the Mexican revolution with the big ole mustaches… I mean when I say Mexican he looked like the typical stereotype of one. I’m thinking about getting a dna test and leaving her because there’s no way it’s mine. Lmk if you guys want a part 2"

He moved with me to a new city for my graduate degree where we adopted 2 cats and got engaged January of 23. He had met B (20f) at work and we all became close friends. We let her stay with us for a week when she needed to escape her ex and helped her move into her new place. In june L started a massive argument right before we went on vacation and broke the new that he thought he was poly and wanted to be able to explore this or he thought he might have to leave me at some point. I’m extremely monogamous and this made me very uncomfortable, but to save my relationship I agreed to try things out casually with B, because I’m bi and I trusted her enough to be vulnerable. My one rule was that nothing sexual should happen with her while the other wasn’t there. Fast forward several weeks and he is spending a ton of time with her when I’m not around, including when I’m out of town with friends. When I got back my anxiety that something had happened was overwhelming and I had a breakdown asking if he had cheated while I was gone. He blew up saying he was hurt, and barely spoke to me for a week. One night I couldn’t sleep and went through his phone, for which I had standing permission to do, and found out he had sexted her multiple times while I was in the room, which broke all my rules. I confronted him with the evidence and instead of trying to work it out he said he was moving out. This moving out process took a month. After attempting to remain friends, B blew up at me. B threatened me, told me I was a horrible person, that I was pathetic, and mocked me on social media before blocking me. L stayed living in our apartment, sleeping in my bed, and spending time with her even when I asked him not to. Finally after a month of him abusing my generosity and emotionally destroying me, he moved out. I helped him, even though B was there and even though I was badly injured. When I dropped by his new place a few days later with stuff he needed, she was there. He told me never to come back to his apartment and said he wanted to go no contact.\nI’m broken. I’m living in an apartment I can’t afford with 2 cats that don’t understand why their dad won’t come home. I lost my best friend and the person I was planning on spending the rest of my life with, and I’m barely coping. I went on a date with a nice guy but I’m terrified to open up to anyone because I don’t feel comfortable being vulnerable, as the last 2 times went so poorly and damaged my mental health so badly. I barely eat because I can’t afford groceries but I can’t move because my cats and I need to stay close to work for my graduate program. I lost a family through this, and I’m not sure how much more I can take.\nEdit 1: there’s some concern about ages. I was 18 when we started dating, I turn 25 in 2 months. No pedophilia here friends.\nEdit 2: I understand I was naive. I should have stood up for myself. I didn’t know what I was doing. This was my first major relationship. I am getting help. I never said I wasn’t learning from this. I likely won’t see your horrible comments but I hope you feel better from posting them. Thank you to everyone who has been kind. I didn’t ask for anything, I was just trying to get a horrible situation off my chest."

It was held at a group of cabins at a lake in Northern Georgia. We have family spread out across the US and every 2 years we pick a location and congregate for the weekend. I did not expect to walk in on THIS kind or congregation though. Devin had met my mother (47 f) once before, at dinner, along with my brother and sister that are both a few years younger than me. Our parents divorced several years ago and my father is busy drinking himself dead with his new girlfriend so he did not attend dinner or the reunion. I did not pick up on any weird vibes or stolen glances at dinner, and mother and I have some boundaries already about dating. She and I are only 21 years apart, both fit and attractive. I like guys older than me and she likes guys younger than her. Mother currently has a boyfriend, Frank (41m). They've been together for about 1.5 years. Frank did not attend the family reunion.\nSo during the reunion, Devin has been distant from me. He found literally anything else to do than have a connection with me all weekend. Before the big meal on Saturday, he told me he didn't find me very attractive. He said I'm too tall, not fit enough, he doesn't like that I have a child (3m), and I smoke too much weed. I know he's grasping at straws. I am a tall woman at 5'11\". But I only weigh 150lbs and I don't work out excessively but I am strong. My son is really cool, and I have to baby daddy to have drama with. Devin should've said something about that a long time ago, right? And for the weed, I only smoke on special occasions.\nAnyway we had a talk and it turned into an argument and Devin stormed out. We were staying in a room in one of the cabins. He stormed out and, apparently, into the RV where my mother was staying.\nI cried a lot and finally composed myself to go talk with my mom like girls do in a breakup right? I opened the RV door and took one step up. I look to my left where I see them both sprawled out on the bed, breathing heavy and freshly orgasmed. They see me and do the \"oh shit\" jump and cover. I said nothing. Just walked over and slapped my mother across the face and walked back out.\nWalking back towards the cabin I see cars arriving with more family members and food to prepare for the final family day feast.\nI have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. Do I tell my family? Do I tell her boyfriend? Do I act like nothing happened until after the party? How can I ever trust my mother again? How can I rebuild my self esteem after a hit like that?\nTldr: My mother slept with my boyfriend during a family reunion."

We had an elderly gentleman patient this case and while we waited for the Doctor to arrive we engaged in friendly chit chat, nothing out of the ordinary. When the doc came in, he immediately asked us if the patient told us his history. I started rattling off the medical reasons why he was having the procedure and the doc cut me off saying “no his past work history as an undercover FBI mob agent”. Naturally my reaction was “ohhhhh no.. that must have been interesting, dealing with those mob guys”. The patients response has haunted me to this day.

We all just stood there in silence while he underwent the procedure.. what the fuck did he just tell us?\nEDIT: Apparently people are getting hung up on the use of the term “informant”.. so I removed it. For clarity, which I thought might have been deduced.. this old man was not a “Mob Informant” in the sense of being a snitch in the mob. He was a retired FBI agent who worked undercover with the mob at one point. In a completely separate point in time, he claimed to have been asked by a congressman for a 13 year old girl.

Do I think he was, NO!\nThe procedure was an EGD “upper endoscopy”\nIt was a surgeon doing post operative surveillance, not a gastroenterologist.\nYou nay sayers need to understand that elite pedophile rings exist and have existed for a very long time.\nPeople taking this as a push for a political world view are wrong.

        "text": "TLDR: I’m divorcing my husband because of his farts. But for the love, please read the whole thing before you comment. Fr.\nI truly wish this were a joke. Part of this whole situation is on me for not dating him for a long time before we got married, and a big chunk of that dating was spent having completely lost my sense of smell from Covid. That fact alone is absolutely unbelievable but it’s true. Side note, I got my smell back. The other wild part is that when we were dating, he hung over at my place mainly, and I didn’t carry a lot of unhealthy snacks for him to snack on at night. This fact is VERY relevant for the story.\nOnce we got married, things went downhill very quickly. He started inhailing as many snacks and as much dairy as possible at night. Sometimes he would go out and get a deep dish, fried cheese, loaded pizza and devour it at 11 PM after eating an entire bag of greasy chips and like 27 pieces of taffy. And a glass of milk. Or 3.\nAt first I thought it was just a bad fart here and there. But as the nights progressed, I realized that the bad farts were becoming a nightly nightmare.\nI know what normal stinky farts are. Even bad sulfuric farts. But, these are not simply either of those. These farts are incompatible with life itself.\nThe first time one really hit me in the face, I projectile vomited. I could taste them. They were are almost tangible objects in the air. I’m convinced they are soaked into the carpet and walls. Rotten egg is not even enough to describe what the smell is. It’s almost as if something literally died inside of his stomach and was leaking into the air trying to kill anyone that smells it.\nHis farts are not human. They are not silly little rotten egg farts. There is something wrong with him. Truly. These farts are almost alive with a mind of their own, and they are terrifying. If there was a horror movie made about farts, it would be about his.\nThey are unsettling at best. They make your mind feel like something bad happened, perhaps a murder. Your spirit does not feel settled because these are not normal farts in anyway at all. These are violently horrifying.\nIt got to the point where I had to stop sleeping in our bedroom the second month of marriage. Not only that, but I had to blast the AC, stuff towels under our door, stuff towels under my daughter’s door, turn the fan on in both rooms, and sleep in her room with her. He snuck into her room and farted when I was almost asleep so that I would start dry heaving. I had to start sleeping with the door locked with her.\nI started routine prescription nausea medicine to keep my food down at night, just in case, because it was becoming kind of health hazard because of how sick it was making me.\nWhen I asked him if he thought the amount of food he was inhaling every night was causing his farts, he said yes. I asked if maybe he could slow down or substitute for healthier snacks, such as sea salt popcorn, or a bit lighter and less full of thick cheese snacks, and he said no. His reasoning? He said he likes the way the farts feel exiting his butt as they vibrate his prostate and butt hole. Like I’m not even kidding-HE FREAKING SAID THAT.\nI’m so horrified that I even typed that.\nMy life became a living nightmare as I could no longer sleep in my room and also remain alive. My desk was in my room, so I also had to stop working in the daytime from my bedroom. He works from home in the bedroom too. I had to change the entire situation just to cater to the pleasure of his farts.\nI tried desperately to get him to go to a doctor, I found referrals to gastroenterologists, I bought him probiotics enzymes, milk substitutes, I cooked healthy meals, he would literally tell me he didn’t want the healthy meal and drive himself to Taco Bell instead. He refused to go to the doctor. He took the probiotic sometimes but usually just pretended to and slipped them by his nightstand so I wouldn’t see that he didn’t take them.\nKnowing I was going to have to remain on prescription nausea meds, possibly for life, just to cohabitate with this man was so mind blowing. Our budget was going crazy to keep up with the demands of the amount of food needed to keep his farting for pleasure needs met. At one point, he literally inhaled so much food so fast and so nonstop that he gained 12 pounds in 48 hours and he looked at the scale and screamed.\nI tried to get him into therapy and a psychiatrist, but no. I am a very body positive person that does not fat shame and genuinely believes that you should eat what makes you feel healthy and good and not worry about hitting some numbers on a scale.\nThe situation, however, feels like a very disastrous issue that is very weird and not very common, something that people probably can’t relate to because it’s just completely absurd in every way.\nHe said he will always choose that vibrational fart feeling and the fart smell and the grease snacks and the cheese above me. He said that is a hill he is forever willing to die on.\nAnyway, that is the story of why I am divorcing my husband over farts. On the surface level, I know it sounds like it’s just about farts and then I’m just a really shallow wife, but I think it’s actually so much deeper. It’s just hard to explain how."

        "text": "Okay, so this story is actually pretty tongue and cheek. I just thought it was hilarious. I 26m and my wife 28f have been together since high school. When we first started dating we took each others virginities when I was 16 and she was 18. We were both still and high school at the time. Honestly the whole relationship was pretty adorable right from the start. Holding hands on the bus, us getting off at the wrong bus stop so I could spend more time walking her home, us kissing on an old wooden bridge while it rained. Very hallmark type of stuff. As we grew older I would tease her that because I was 16 and she was technically an adult that means she technically groomed me (her being a 5'2 innocent catholic girl and me being a 5'9 lacrosse player). Her deflection for this was that the age of consent in our state is 16. But one night we were drinking and the same old joke came up. That led us to do some research on the actual law. Turns out yes the age of consent is 16 but the relationship has to at the approval of the younger parties parents. My wife then claimed that because my mom would buy my condoms for Christmas it was my mom's way of consenting to us having sex. Fast forward to this year. My mother was staying over at the house because she was on a business trip and didn't want to pay for any hotels. Once again I brought up the joke and my wife then used her Trump card about my mom buying condoms which means everything was cool. My mom then turned and looked at her and said, \"I didn't consent to you too having sex. I just bought my son condoms because I didn't want him getting any girls pregnant. I knew I couldn't stop him from having sex, but if he was going to I wanted him to use protection.\" I don't think I've laughed that hard in years. So now because of this revelation. I can now say the canonical story of events for me and my wife's long and very happy marriage starts with her grooming me as a young teen, technically molesting me, and then through her manipulating my young mind she convinced me to buy and ring and propose to her on the top of a mountain over looking a lake on a camping trip we went on together. Long story short, according to reddit logic. My wife is a pedophile and a child molester and I've sentenced her to asking for forgiveness over her large collection of Jesus candles (I told her not to be looking at the baby Jesus candle because I just know.)\nBefore the comments section starts freaking out. Yes I know there are real victims in this world and this story isn't ment to belittle their experience. I'm just trying to tell a wholesome and funny story that's finally come to a close.\nEdit- This post has made me realize that a lot of people either don't have a friendship with their significant other where there are recurring jokes or they aren't in a relationship with their best friend. They're in a relationship with their bully."

        "text": "My wife (Gwen, 31F) and I (Robert, 33M) have been together for 11 years and married for 8. We have a set of 4 year old twins (M/F). Our relationship the last 3 years has been spectacular. We spend at least one night a week together on a date, sex is regular, we discuss everything, have long intimate conversations, and financially we are hitting full stride, both of us have growing careers. It wasn't always this good, but never has been bad either. We have grown up together. We had a lot of the typical couple issues early on and throughout our 20s. But each challenge just seemed to bring us closer in the end.\nThat's what makes what I found out 2 days ago so much more devastating. My wife has been cheating on me.\nEvery June, my wife and her best friend, Scarlett, take a girls trip. It's been a tradition they've done since they were 18. It's nothing crazy, they usually just pick a nearby touristy town and spend the weekend shopping, or laying by a pool, or doing spa treatments. Nothing too over the top. She has this year's trip already booked and it's in just a couple of weeks.\nThe other day, I was looking at our bank account app, and it wanted some mandatory info verification for privacy sake. I clicked the button and it went into 2 step authorization. Clicked okay and it said it had to send me a code via text, but it's my wife's phone tied to the account. I begrudgingly got up and went and found her phone. I would normally ask but she was napping and I didn't want to wake her. I picked the phone up and hit for the code to unlock since it obviously wasn't going to recognize my face. I know the pin it's the same thing she uses for everything.\nOnce unlocked she has Snapchat open, and there's a message from her bff in the chat. It says, \"Are you really going to go through with it?\" A sense of dread washed over me. I really had no reason to feel this way, but something about the question just felt so off. I thought hard about how my wife would respond, and typed back, \"Why wouldn't I?\" Scarlett responded, \"I'm just saying, 2 guys at once is pretty intense.\"\nMy heart dropped, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Knowing I couldn't keep the charade up I stopped responding and began looking through the Snaps. There were 2 guys I vaguely recognized as being from my wife's past. Unfortunately, it's Snapchat, so when I clicked on them there was nothing there. I went into her phone deeper. Nothing in her texts or email. I look through a oddly named folder and in it is Whatsapp. Here are the messages I was looking for. Her messaging with her old HS boyfriend (Donald 31M), making plans for their upcoming \"girls\" trip. No smoking gun, no sexts or pics, but definitely flirty. Definitely making plans to meet at the hotel, and definitely planning on him bringing his college roommate, who was also my wife's 2nd boyfriend (Jon, 32M).\nI couldn't believe she would do this. I was also wondering how long this has been going on. There are not a lot of messages, but I could tell that this won't be the first time Donald has joined her on the \"girls trip.\" I knew since Scarlett would figure out that I sent that last response, I had to confront my wife when she awoke.\nWhen she finally awoke, some gruelling 45 minutes later, she immediately picked up her phone. She didn't even notice me sitting in the chair in the corner of our room. After looking at her snaps, and sending a few back to Scarlett she finally put 2 and 2 together and realized I had been on her phone. She looked over and finally noticed my presence. Her first words, said in a very aggravated tone, were, \"Did you go through my phone?\"\nBefore I could even get a word out she starts laying into me about invasion of privacy. I became immediately engaged. How dare she blame me for anything. I tell her I know she is cheating, that she's talking to Donald and Jon, and that her and Scarletts trip is just a cover. At first she tries to deny everything. Tries to gaslight me. Telling me I'm reading too much into the messages, that she is just catching up with old friends and knew I would act like this, that's why she didn't tell me they were going to get lunch. It was all bullshit.\nI got so mad this whole thing devolved into just screaming and yelling. I told her I wanted a divorce, and she said, \"Really, you're going to throw away over 10 years over a couple of nothing texts.\" Implying I was the one throwing things away, made me see the darkest red, and I said what I knew would get under her skin far more than anything else, \"I'm not the one throwing it away you stupid cunt.\"\nNow I knew this would drive her crazy. She HATES that word. She even gets upset when TV characters say it. I've never seen her that mad but it worked. She totally flipped and screamed at me that she \"Does this for us.\" I was mind blown by that statement, but she wasn't done. I'm paraphrasing from memory but basically she just raginly started spouting off everything:\n\"WHY DO YOU THINK OUR RELATIONSHIP GETS BETTER EVERY FUCKING YEAR, I DESERVE THIS. It's my free weekend, it lets me handle all the bullshit from the year, resets me. If you can't understand that that's your problem. So fucking what if I'm crossing some lines, are you not fucking happy. We have it great, and all it costs is me getting one weekend a year off. (At this point she softened a little but kept a stern tone). I get it, your pride is hurt, but it has nothing to do with you, this is for me. You can have a great life, I just need this once a year, and you need to make peace with that. We have a good thing going, don't fuck it up because you're mad now.\"\nI couldn't believe what I heard. I felt literally woozy in that moment. My chest tightened. This woman was out of her mind. I didn't say a word. I left the room, went to my car and headed for my brother's house. When I arrived I just texted my wife \"I'm at Mickey's, please dont message me, I need time.\"\nI've been hanging out here for 2 days just under the guise of generic marital problems. She has texted me each morning asking me to come home and talk. I responded both times \"not yet.\" I don't know what to do, I've never been hurt so badly, or so callously. I love her, but this is too much, I plan to go back home tomorrow and try and sort this out. I don't see how we ever come back from this.\nUpdate 1"

        "text": "I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (26F) for 3 years, and we've been living together for almost the entire time. Two months ago, she received a job offer that would essentially require us to move further away from my job and my brother. I asked her not to accept the job, but she thought it would be good for her career, so I eventually conceded and agreed to move with her.\nShe informed her current job that she was leaving, and during that week, she came to me and said she wasn't sure if things would work out between us because I had been so unsupportive. She mentioned she was unhappy and that I didn't make her feel special. This news really shook me because I always envisioned a future with her. The thought of losing her over something seemingly trivial motivated me to take action.\nI immediately booked a fancy hotel room for us and took her out to show her how much I loved her. She agreed that we could take it day by day, so I did everything possible to make her believe in us again. I woke up early to cook breakfast, sent her sweet messages, and did everything I could think of to make her feel special.\nLater that week, I overheard her laughing on the phone with her boss, which gave me a weird feeling. I had always felt uncomfortable with how unprofessional she seemed with him, especially since they would hang out outside of work (in groups with coworkers). That night, while she was sleeping, I decided to check her phone—not expecting to find anything but just to be sure. However, the texts I found between her and her boss were extremely suggestive. I woke her up and confronted her. She admitted that he had confessed his feelings for her and that she might have feelings for him. She said he had kissed her once when she told him she was leaving the company, but nothing had happened since. She also told me that he had been trying to convince her to leave me.\nWe stayed up all night talking, and I told her that I could move on if she recommitted to our relationship and cut off all contact with him. The next day was her last day at her old job, and she told me she had the conversation with him and blocked him. The next six weeks were incredibly difficult for me, but I eventually started to feel better. However, there were a few inconsistencies in her story that bothered me.\nI wanted to move forward, get engaged, and recommit, but I needed to know the whole truth. So, I reached out to her boss. He told me that they had kissed three times, not just once, and the last time they kissed was when she told him she was going to try to reconcile with me (on her last day of work, after I found out). He also mentioned that they had talked a little the following week after she claimed she had blocked him and promised me she would never lie again.\nNow, I don't know what to do. I kicked her out of our apartment and said we couldn't live together anymore, but she keeps telling me she'll do anything to make it work between us. I told her I needed two weeks before we could talk again, but I don't know if I can ever get over this. Did she choose him over me? Was I the second option? What would have happened if I never found out? I don't know if I should move on or try to make it work. I still love her, and we have so much history together. We've gone on family vacations, and I had planned to propose within a few months. I'm so confused and feel alone. Are all women like this? Is there any chance of rebuilding trust?"

        "text": "So, about 3 weeks ago I flew to South Korea for a vacation with friends who live there. My husband didn't want to go and said he'd be fine staying home and watching the house and dog. I trusted him because he's a 40 year old adult man and assumed he'd be able to feed himself like a sane person despite him possessing the cooking ability of a cactus. I was wrong. I should've dragged him and the dog along with me to another country.\nWhat my husband decided to do during his 3 weeks without me was absurd. I would've been happier if he'd cheated on me instead. Because what he did was: order nothing but Taco Bell through DoorDash after he: somehow broke my stove by: cooking an entire 15lbs bag of red lentils all at once. Then he didn't bother to get a bowl for his lentils, he just ate them straight from the pot and stuffed the pot into the fridge and broke one of the shelves inside it. Now realizing his mistake, he decided to order nothing but terrible tacos for the remaining 2 weeks while getting high on medical marijuana. Also for some reason he bought a bunch of honeycombs from one of our friend's fathers and decided those made a good snack and has eaten nothing but beeswax and honey for the last few days because he's some kind of weird alien in a human disguise. Apparently honeycombs give you gas. And lentils give you gas. And Taco Bell gives you gas.\nSo now it's today and I'm awoken by what sounds like someone revving a motorcycle in my bedroom followed by the stench of the fiery pits of hell itself. It's 5:30 in the morning. He gets up and goes to use the toilet as I'm opening the windows in a poor attempt to ventilate the house but it's too late. He doesn't even have a solid poop, it's just 10 minutes of gas. Like 20 seconds of nonstop farts followed by a huge gasp of air and then another 20 seconds of gas. By this time, the dog has hidden under my couch because it doesn't know what those loud honking noises are and fears for its safety. I consider joining it, but continue to open every window in my house. It's 62 degrees out and windy. The wind just blows the fart smell around the house. My husband has left the bathroom and has walked upstairs. It sounds like there's a small 2-stroke engine in his pants.\nI can't take it anymore and scream that I'm going to get breakfast at the diner and leave him. I bring the dog with me because the dog follows me out of the house because it also doesn't want to be here right now. So now I'm at the diner waiting for my husband to de-gas himself while the dog sits underneath the table next to me wearing a pink leash-kid harness that my friends bought for me as a gag gift that has my name and \"Emotional Support Human\" on it that the waitress thought was some kind of in-joke.\nThis is the start of my morning. I hope it's not as stinky as yours."

        "text": "Well, a couple of weeks ago I found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago, the way I found out is that her sister told me after going to visit her to find out how the delivery of her first child was, she confessed to me that 6 years ago my wife told her that she slept drunk with her best friend, in her words, my wife was very sorry.\nAt the time she told me I was with my \"son\" and immediately after leaving her house I went to take a paternity test with him, fearing the worst.\nA week later I get the results and my fears came true, my son is not mine, for some reason, I began to see the boy differently, more as an acquaintance than a son, with proofs in hand I confronted my wife at night when the child was sleeping, she asked me who told me and I simply told her that it is none of her business, although obviously it will not take long to connect the dots that it was her sister, well, that is not my problem now.\nRegardless of that, I asked her for a divorce, which is now in process, she was \"devastated\", she swore to me more than once that nothing happened with anyone again, that she has been faithful to me in body and soul since then, I held back the urge to insult her to avoid complications during the divorce issue, not believing a word she said, mostly blaming the alcohol instead of taking the blame herself.\nAfter talking about it, she threatened me saying that she would demand full custody of the child, I was so annoyed at that moment that I told her okay, I don't want anything to do with something that is not mine, that she keep the child and I'll keep the dogs (we have two dogs that we adopted as puppies and they are currently 8 years old each) after my words she tried to convince me to take care of the child with her, that I am his father, at that moment I exploded, I was so angry and I had held back so much the urge to scream that I just yelled her to go and take her bastard with her.\nA week has passed since that and I am at home (it is in my name because it is a gift from my parents), she went to her parents' house with her kid, she has not called me since then, she left with everything and the half-asleep kid when I yelled at her, especially since it was the first time I really yelled at her, it sure affected her.\nI talked to my parents and my dad told me that I did the right thing and that I shouldn't be raising something that is not of my blood, and I agree with him, however, the pain is still there, my younger brother told me to write here to entertain myself, I am currently seeing a therapist 3 times a week, who told me that I have already taken the first step, which was to leave behind what causes me pain, it just hurts to know that my family no longer exists.\nRegarding why my sister-in-law told me everything, according to her, she felt guilty seeing me always happy with my son, knowing that he may not be mine, and that the fact that we went to visit her in a moment of weakness caused her to completely break down with guilt, I don't know how true that is, I just know that right now I feel tremendous hatred for my wife and a feeling between pain and resentment for the child, although it's just time to get ahead.\nI just hope the divorce goes smoothly, we have separate financers and properties and if she really asks for child support I have proof that it's not mine, according to my lawyer that's more than enough if she tries a legal process for that, my therapist also recommended that I not see him nor her, that regardless of the child's feelings, I should focus on my own first, that the child is no longer my problem and the sooner I accept it, the better.\nSorry for the misspellings, English is not my first language."

After one particularly intense session, he hugged me for a little too long. The line began to blur, and I started to develop feelings for him. One evening, after a deeply personal conversation about my progress and how I wish I had someone to celebrate with, he invited me to grab some drinks. I thought it was just him being kind and supportive, but in the back of my head I honestly hoped he'd confirm having similar feelings that I'd been having.\nWe sat closer than usual, at one point he even reached out to hold my hand. I could feel the tension between us. He complimented my progress and told me how proud he was of me. That's honestly what sent me even further into this intense feeling of lust. His words were soothing, and before I knew it, we were kissing. It felt surreal, like a dream. One thing led to another, and we ended up going back to his place and sleeping together.

I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs.

A little info about me. I have a chronic stomach wound which pops up whenever I'm really stressed.\nThe relationship was very new so we were both still quite shy, we had just gotten comfortable enough farting in front of each other tho, and often made a joke out of it. About a month into our relationship I had to go to the hospital with my stomach wound, I was there for a week and he was super supportive the whole time. When I finally got home from the hospital my body was so weak, I wasn't allowed to drink or eat anything the whole week because of the tests they had to make. Therefore my body had pretty much shut down, nothing had come in, so nothing came out. I got prescribed some laxatives that I took, never having taken them before I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't this! We were laying in bed, I was on my side looking at my phone, and he was half sitting up in bed playing RuneScape on his laptop in front of me. I could feel a fart coming, so I looked up into his eyes with a smirk face expression and said: \"I'm shitting!\"\nI meant to say \"I'm farting\" but the words came out wrong.. and so did something else. The moment I said it, I let it all out, still with a smirk face expression looking him right in the eyes. You could hear a wet bubbly sound, and I instantly knew what had happened. My smile fated and my face turned to horror, my hand flew down to stop the flow but it was too late. Boyfriend jumped up and ran to the toilet to bring me paper, he helped me clean up while just laughing hysterically, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even say anything.\nLater when we sat and talked he told me that it was the most intimidating thing he had ever experienced, the way I looked right into his eyes, he had never felt so dominated in his life. \"Like a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it\". Needless to say we got very quickly comfortable with intimate things like that after this. Even tho we've broken up since then and it's been a few years, I'm to this day still just as embarrassed."

With a very serious look on my face, I showed her that I was taking a moment to consider what she had just asked.\nThen I replied to her \"Hmmm.....Well okay, you've got a deal. If you get good grades all through school and college I will let you start dating at 29\".\nShe replied, \"okay daddy\", got out of the car, and bounced her way on into school for the day.\nFor those who are going to ask, yes she waited till she was 29 to start dating, because she always followed daddy's rules.\nJust kidding.\nShe had her first boyfriend at around 13 years old, breaking her Daddy's heart."

        "text": "Four days ago I was walking with a coworker on a break just to stretch our legs. We work in an office setting so like to get up every once in a while and get some fresh air. We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of 15 concrete steps.\nIt was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go \"Oh god\" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.\nI freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.\nThe ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR\nI feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.\nHe was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.\nI don't really know why I'm writing all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.\nEDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction. I appreciate all the advice and positive thoughts sent my way. It saddens me that many of you have similar experiences. I can't respond to every comment but I am reading every single one. Thank you!"

My whole life until last year, I've only dated women, and I get grossed out thinking of myself with a guy. My boyfriend and I met at an event we both volunteered for, and we became friends. We got closer, and I started thinking about him more and more. When I realized that I developed feelings for him, it terrified me. My whole life, I'd thought I was a lesbian, and then I developed feelings for a guy. Everything I knew was wrong. I tried distancing myself from him in hopes the feelings would go away, but they didn't. I kept thinking about him, and I eventually gave in and asked him out. Once I convinced him that I wasn't joking, he accepted, and we started dating.\nDating him wasn't that different than dating a girl. The sex was so weird, but he was so accommodating. The first couple of times, he made sure I was comfortable and he was so careful and gentle. The thought of me with any other guy still grosses me out, but being with my boyfriend makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I have no idea why he's the only guy I like, but the year we've been together has been probably the best year of my life. He gets me, and he gives the best hugs. We live together, and he's an amazing roommate and an amazing boyfriend.\nEdit: spelling"

        "text": "Hi, I'm a 35 year old woman married to a 45 year old man for over 7 years. We have 4 beautiful kids. My husband recently had his birthday this week. I surprised him with a pregnancy test result that we will be having a 5th child. He seemed to have a meltdown when he heard it and he said no, it is impossible, we have been careful. I thought he would be happy as he said it himself when we were dating that he wants a lot of kids. I calmed him down somehow... Yesterday, I went with my husband to the gynecologist to have my sonogram and the doctor says I am 10 weeks pregnant and we are having twins. My husband was livid. He keeps screaming no no no no no. I lost count of him saying no. After his meltdown at doctors office he told me that he just can't have 6 kids at his age. I got confused as what he is saying- as I know he wanted a big family. he wanted it himself. I cried and told him what are we supposed to do and he keep saying that he just can't have 6 kids. On our way home he says how he should not have gotten married and have kids and he does not know anymore if his life is worth it, that he'd be happy to have a reset button. I got so mad I told him that it takes two to tango, that creating a kid is not just my fault. Today I woke up with screaming and crying kids begging their father to not go. Turns out he already packed and ready to go. My 3 year old is hugging his fathers luggage and crying and his face is stoic. By then I knew I was stupid to committing a mistake of marrying him. It maybe hard as I am pregnant right now, but I got a full time job and we do have a nanny and supportive family and friends. It is best if he go, I do not need another baby to take care of. So, to my dear soon to be ex-husband Jerry, F*CK YOU. don't come back."

        "text": "My husband, John \"Bucky\" (M26), and I (F24) just returned from our week-long honeymoon two weeks ago. We call my husband \"Bucky\" because he resembles the character from the MCU movies. My Bucky is a bit more yummy.\nYesterday was the first time we had dinner with his family since the wedding. My sister-in-law (F20) is my favorite person besides my husband, which is why she was my Maid of Honor. She took me aside and told me what happened behind the scenes at my wedding.\nA bit of background first: My mother-in-law (F48) never liked me, and she didn't hide it from me, though she did hide it from her son. This started from the moment we began dating. She would play nice in front of him but make nasty comments as soon as he was out of sight. At first, I didn't say anything to Bucky, hoping that, in time, his mother would warm up to me. But it never stopped. Eventually, I had enough and started telling Bucky.\nBucky spoke with his mother, but she claimed I was misunderstanding her. She didn't stop; she just became subtler, saying things that could be interpreted in multiple ways. I don't blame Bucky, he did believe me, but he also believed his mother when she said she meant something else.\nWhen Bucky proposed, I thought that would be the end of it, but she only got sneakier. I almost called off the wedding because I couldn't handle it anymore. We had arguments, and it was frustrating. Bucky always believed me but didn’t believe it was his mother’s intent to be hurtful. Somehow, we got through it and started planning the wedding.\nMy sister-in-law helped with the wedding planning and preparations, and because my mother-in-law was minimally involved, everything was perfect.\nFrom my perspective, everything went as planned on the wedding day, though we started a bit later. Bucky told me it couldn't be avoided because something important came up last minute. I assumed it was work-related, so I didn’t ask.\nBut now I've heard from my sister-in-law what actually happened. I was in the bridal suite, so I didn’t see or hear any of this.\nMy mother-in-law arrived at the venue wearing white. When Bucky found out, he asked my sister-in-law to bring her to his ready room, along with his other siblings and father.\nWhen my mother-in-law walked in and tried to hug him, Bucky stopped her. He asked what she was wearing, and when she dismissed it, he repeated the question differently: Why was she wearing white at his wedding? Why was she trying to hurt his soon-to-be wife? Why was she trying to ruin his wedding day?\nI think phrasing it as his day rather than my day got to his mother. He reminded her that it was his wedding too. She still tried to dismiss it, saying he was overreacting and it was just a dress.\nThat’s when he lost it. He started yelling at his mother, saying that he now realized I wasn't misunderstanding her—she was deliberately being hurtful to me. He yelled that he had been defending her to me all this time, but now it was clear that I was the one who needed defending. He accused his mother of trying to sabotage his relationship. When my father-in-law tried to say something, Bucky shut him down, saying he didn't want to hear it because they had stood by and enabled her behavior.\nBucky then told his mother, \"Because you're my mother, I'm willing to postpone the wedding by half an hour to give you a chance to change. I don't care if you go home, to a store, or wherever. Just leave now and only come back when you've changed. If you refuse, you will never see me, my wife, or our future children ever again. Do I make myself clear?\"\nThe wedding was perfect, and my mother-in-law wore a blue dress.\nI don't know how to thank this man enough. His birthday is in three months, and I’m going to have to plan something extra special.\nAn update"

        "text": "Last week while my wife (49F) was taking a shower I (50M) saw a notification pop up on her phone and went to open it thinking it was one of our daughter’s (Maddy 24F and Alice 26F) confirming what time their girl’s dinner was.\nInstead I saw an unsaved number saying “I can’t wait to see you!” And then kissing emoji. I froze for a second. I clicked on the message and saw a short thread mostly confirming dinner plans for that evening and how they missed each other and once a week just wasn’t enough. I knew what I saw. 29 years of marriage down the drain.\nHoping to catch her in a lie before she left the house, I texted both our daughters and asked them about girls dinner. What happened next broke me to my core. Both girls confirmed the dinner and said they were excited. I couldn’t believe it.\nNot proud of what came next. I turned her location sharing on with me in her phone and let her leave. I followed her to a restaurant and lo and behold neither daughter was there but instead a man I knew was her boss. I was so heartbroken. Part of me was hoping I was just a paranoid freak and my daughters would be there happy to see me! But no, just my cheating wife and her AP. I took pictures of the two of them holding hands, and kissing. I know I should have waited but I couldn’t help myself, I was so angry. As soon as I got in my car, I opened the group chat we had as a family, sent them all the photos and said “Glad you’re enjoying girls dinner together!”\nI then turned my phone off and drove to my brothers house and asked to stay the night. I woke up the next morning to over 40 texts and 20 voicemails.\nMy wife went through the cheaters playbook of excuses. I didn’t even listen to her voicemails. I was about to respond with: “I will be getting a divorce, I recommend a lawyer.” But my brother stopped me. He told me to meet with a bunch of lawyers first and make sure she couldn’t use them.\nInstead I just sent the group chat a simple message: “I am physically fine, but need time. I will come home when I’m ready.” I then muted my phone.\nI called different lawyers that looked to be the best in town that morning for appointments. Met with all of them, and picked the one who looked ready to treat this as scorched earth as possible.\nFinally after spending all day with lawyers, I looked through the messages and both my daughters were apologizing. My younger daughter, the daddy’s girl of the two, was manic. She had texted me almost 50 times saying she never should have lied and hated it every time. Her boyfriend even reached out asking me to please reach out to her, that he didn’t know what was going on but that she was on the verge of a panic attack.\n“Maddy, I love you but please understand that what you’ve done has hurt me deeply, I need you to give me space.”\nI sent it and within seconds got a “okay, I’m so sorry, I never should have helped, I’ll never forgive myself. I love you too.”\nI didn’t respond. Alice was different. We always had a good relationship but she was a momma’s girl through and through. She said she was sorry but that I shouldn’t throw away a good marriage because of one mistake. This made me furious.\n“Alice, this isn’t a mistake, this is a betrayal. From my whole family. Please don’t reach out again until I make first contact.”\nShe never responded but I know she showed it to me STBX because she started saying that I shouldn’t take this out on Alice. I never responded. I’ll never talk to her again except through lawyers.\nThis all happened 5 days ago. I’m still at my brothers and can’t contain my feelings. I cry every morning and most of the day. I oscillate between complete dipilitating sadness and all-consuming anger. Losing my wife will be hard enough but how do I ever look at my children again? How do I even begin to forgive them? Alice is supposed to get married in the fall, I’ve been paying for almost everything, now I’m probably not going to go.\nI don’t even know how to move forward. I am completely destroyed.\nUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/csLL5xrC4x"

I hoped it would end quickly, but the COO kept asking questions. Eventually, I couldn’t hold it any longer and soiled myself during the interview.\nDespite the unfortunate situation, the COO said I was a great fit for the position and offered me a job with a three times higher salary than my previous one, along with excellent benefits.

Well she read that if you give yourself an enema with coffee it can help cleanse toxins from your body (cue collective eye roll). BIL comes home one day to a scary looking mess in the bathroom; what appears to be blood soaked pads, towels, etc. BIL freaks out and immediately begins asking SIL what happened and if she’s okay. SIL gets very cagey and avoidant of his questions. BIL continues panicking thinking something is incredibly wrong and SIL needs to go to the ER. Finally, BIL gets her to spill. After reading on the internet that it is healthy and beneficial to give yourself and enema with coffee she decided to try it! Only she missed one very important step in letting your coffee cool down first before you try to insert it into your asshole. So SIL gave herself and unsuccessful enema with hot coffee and literally burned her rectum. She refused to go to the doctor out of embarrassment. This is my favorite story that I have ever had the pleasure of hearing in my life and now it gets to grace Reddit as well\n***edited to add BIL in this post is SILs husband, sorry for the confusion I should have written that part better. SIL reluctantly relayed this story to my husband (her brother) at great urging from her husband\nEdit: this happened months ago and as far as I know SIL has not suffered any side effects from this. We are no longer on speaking terms due to how she decided to treat my husband, my mother in law (her mother), and myself. It was not actually blood on the towels and pads but a coffee/poo mixture."

        "text": "I (36 m) have been with my wife (35f) for 17 years. We have 3 children together. I was always of the mindset that I wanted monogamy in life, one woman to come home to and that id be with for the long haul. I had women try to talk to me over the years but I never pursued it because I was completely content in my marriage, my wife was my dream girl and i never wanted to hurt her. Over the years there was 2 occasions where I discovered she was being unfaithful in our marriage. One was an off and on again affair that lasted a few years with her married coworker & the other was a fling with an ex she'd dated in high school when she went to visit her family states away.\nI'm sure there will be people who say I am stupid which looking back I can't even deny myself but, after a period of seperation with both situations I decided to forgive my wife as I never wanted to raise my children in a broken home like I had been and i really felt like we could make it through it. We were young whenever the situation with her coworker happened so I chalked it up to being young and making dumb choices without thinking.\nFor a while things were seemingly okay, I never fully trusted her but I tried my best to push back my doubts because I knew if I decided to forgive her then I had to do my best to move past it and have a clean slate. It's been 4 years since the 2nd time she'd been unfaithful & I felt like I made the right decision by letting her have that chance to show she still wanted to be in our marriage. She was a different person for years and we were happy and even had various things set in motion for the future of our family. However, 2 months ago my reality was once again shattered by yet another incident which in my mind was by far worse than the others.\nI ended up receiving a message from one of my best friends wives. This friend knew my wife a little, he'd met her in passing but it wasn't like we all hung out together or anything like that for me to even worry about them. We worked together so there was some times my wife would bring him up multiple times while we were talking about work, she would bring me coffee to work and also one for him. I noticed when she did she'd dress in more revealing clothing than she usually wore but i never commented on it. She even convinced me that we should buy him a joint birthday present & take him out for drinks on his birthday. Just little things like that which were obviously weird but like I said I didn't think I had anything to worry about with either of them. To my knowledge he had a good marriage with his wife, he never spoke badly about it so i didnt think hed have any interest either. Not to mention we we'd actually been friends for a very long time and i trusted him. I'd make comments in a joking way to my wife about how she took too much of an interest in him and she laughed it off saying she just wanted to have another couple to be friends with.(she never actually tried to plan anything as far as to hang out with him and his wife as a couple) I agreed they would be good to be friends with so again I never thought too much into the overly friendliness of my wife with him. Turns out I was way wrong not to because I was met with multiple screenshots implying they were engaged in a full out affair. I wanted to get my proof situated before I ended up confronting my wife because I didn't want her to have the opportunity to manipulate the situation or try to lie her way out of it. So I started to go through call logs, credit statements etc. Because I didn't know how far this actually went past the social media screenshots I saw.\nWhen the truth came out, neither of them tried to lie to me about it. I found out they were sneaking off to hotels when she was supposed to be doing doubles at work and he was supposed to be off with family. And that my friend would leave work to go see her at her job basically every day for a month & she'd meet up with him on his lunch breaks. They were even planning a weekend at a hotel for the next weekend before the truth came out. I obviously cut ties with my friend and honestly I have no idea what to do about my situation with my wife. Their affair ended and my wife apologized profusely saying she just got carried away. She said that she'd felt lacking in our marriage with both of us dedicating so much time to work/other things and that my friend was there and a \"nice guy\", she said she let herself envy the way he treated his wife and wished she could've had that with me but was afraid to tell me i wasnt doing enough in our marriage. So in her words, she made a mistake and that she didn't know how to end it once it started.\nFor now we are living in the same house because realistically neither of us have the means to leave right now as her family doesn't live here plus the costs of renting and houses here are absurd and on top of that we still have our children in our house who are all still in school. She is basically trying to do anything to keep me around including telling me I can see women casually outside of our marriage as long as i come home to her she would never hold it against me as cheating. I told her that's not much of a marriage & it's certainly not anything I ever set out to have but she is hellbent on keeping our family together by any means. She's even brought up how we shouldn't let our kids live in a broken home because of our marital issues.\nI guess my wife is under the impression that nothing could make me want out of this marriage and that by offering things like that she thinks will fix our marriage. I guess in a way that is my fault for letting so much slide in the past. I do love her in some ways but at this point I think the love is more just from the fact we have kids together & that I've been with her for nearly 2 decades rather than feelings of being in love. My self confidence is low and my wife is out of my league but still i dont think that's enough of a reason to stay. She claims she loves me and doesn't want to loose all we've built and are building toward but to me I just can't see how that can be true when she was so okay with running around with one of my only friends. I can't trust her, to me her word is meaningless, I forgive her then how long until she goes and does it again? I do think people can make mistakes & be forgiven because people are flawed, but this isn't just one slip up. And truth be told my faith in her is so low I don't even know if there's been more instances on top of the ones I actually know about. My mental state is essentially a puddle of mud right now.\nI'm sure there's probably someone reading this calling me a dumbass and I can't even argue that but yeah basically my life is a shit show and I don't know how to proceed\nedit; I'm not staying with my wife i should have clarified that better. Me saying I don't know how to proceed is more talking about how to go about handling this with my children, I've never dealt with anything legal so the stress of having to meet with lawyers and also not knowing how to go about our living situation. I have enough proof that my wife couldn't flip the switch and take everything from me but as a guy that's always something you have to worry about. Thankyou for your words, and some of you saying I'm a dumbass- trust me I know, can't change that now unfortunately. Just have to keep moving forward."

One day she had come on to me being very flirty and persuading me To have sex with her. Now that I look back I think she was already pregnant at this point and wanted it to look like I had gotten her knocked up. Of course like any man would I fucked her and came inside. About a month later she was telling me she was pregnant, I was cool with it why not. When it came down to having our second son I noticed that about a year into it, he looked nothing like me or my wife, keep in mind we are both WHITE, I have blond hair and brown eyes, my skin is super pale and my wife is just almost the same. This kid the more he grew was really dark skinned Mexican hair and looked like one of the guys you’d see from the Mexican revolution with the big ole mustaches… I mean when I say Mexican he looked like the typical stereotype of one.

In june L started a massive argument right before we went on vacation and broke the new that he thought he was poly and wanted to be able to explore this or he thought he might have to leave me at some point. I’m extremely monogamous and this made me very uncomfortable, but to save my relationship I agreed to try things out casually with B, because I’m bi and I trusted her enough to be vulnerable. My one rule was that nothing sexual should happen with her while the other wasn’t there. Fast forward several weeks and he is spending a ton of time with her when I’m not around, including when I’m out of town with friends. When I got back my anxiety that something had happened was overwhelming and I had a breakdown asking if he had cheated while I was gone. He blew up saying he was hurt, and barely spoke to me for a week. One night I couldn’t sleep and went through his phone, for which I had standing permission to do, and found out he had sexted her multiple times while I was in the room, which broke all my rules. I confronted him with the evidence and instead of trying to work it out he said he was moving out. This moving out process took a month. After attempting to remain friends, B blew up at me. B threatened me, told me I was a horrible person, that I was pathetic, and mocked me on social media before blocking me. L stayed living in our apartment, sleeping in my bed, and spending time with her even when I asked him not to. Finally after a month of him abusing my generosity and emotionally destroying me, he moved out. I helped him, even though B was there and even though I was badly injured. When I dropped by his new place a few days later with stuff he needed, she was there. He told me never to come back to his apartment and said he wanted to go no contact.\nI’m broken. I’m living in an apartment I can’t afford with 2 cats that don’t understand why their dad won’t come home. I lost my best friend and the person I was planning on spending the rest of my life with, and I’m barely coping. I went on a date with a nice guy but I’m terrified to open up to anyone because I don’t feel comfortable being vulnerable, as the last 2 times went so poorly and damaged my mental health so badly. I barely eat because I can’t afford groceries but I can’t move because my cats and I need to stay close to work for my graduate program. I lost a family through this, and I’m not sure how much more I can take.\nEdit 1: there’s some concern about ages. I was 18 when we started dating, I turn 25 in 2 months. No pedophilia here friends.\nEdit 2: I understand I was naive. I should have stood up for myself. I didn’t know what I was doing. This was my first major relationship. I am getting help. I never said I wasn’t learning from this. I likely won’t see your horrible comments but I hope you feel better from posting them. Thank you to everyone who has been kind. I didn’t ask for anything, I was just trying to get a horrible situation off my chest."

I woke up to a text saying ‘I’m sorry I’m a piece of shit’.\nHaven’t been cheated on in 2 decades and I’m sitting at a bar beside myself. How is your Saturday going?\nE: thanks for all your concerns.

We would talk a everyday and go on dates a lot, etc. The first red flag I should have noticed was on the day he asked me to be his girlfriend. He got a call from his girl best friend. Who we will call Emma. She started complaining that he didn’t call her that day and he instantly started apologising and completely blanked me for 5 minutes. At the time I found it a bit odd but didn’t think much of it. I soon found out she is oddly obsessive over my ex and would always complain about how he wasn’t spending enough time with her. A couple months went by with these calls becoming more and more frequent and one day I got a text from him saying he was working late and he might just visit Emma as she lives close by. For context she lives about a 2 minute walk from the hospital at where he works. He said that I shouldn’t expect him to come home any time soon. A couple days went by and I assume they hooked up multiple times. I was heartbroken. However, yesterday he rang my doorbell saying he didn’t have any place to stay in which I promptly replied no and shut the door in his face."

I grew up in the North East of England and have moved to the North West for university, this meant a lot as it meant it takes effort to see my friends from home and before I moved I got in an unexpected relationship that caused a lot of issues. The girl (19F) was someone who I met online, I had the likes of tinder on my phone but I was never really looking for a relationship I was looking for someone to help me with trans stuff, learning makeup and such. My ex (ill refer to her as A) was someone who I trusted as I used to be really closed off about being transgender, well the first time we met up we really hut it off, it was the perfect first unexpected date and we asked each other out, fast forward a few months and were regularly together and are intimate with each other very often, however, I felt uncomfortable with some stuff as I had vet bad issues with my body and sometimes while intimate I'd feel disgusting and like I wasn't in the right body and felt like I had to stop, she didn't like this and regularly made me do things that made me uncomfortable. She ended up cheating on me while I was at university and I know it sounds stupid but I didn't care she was doing it, she was the first person I was intimate with and I wanted it to last and i thought I just wasn't giving her enough. We ended up breaking up because I finally mentioned i knew she was doing it and that I wanted to know if its because I want enough or if I needed to do more. After the breakup I was lost, I felt like I had lost everything and it led to me attempting, I had 4 attempts within a week. My university placed me on watch as my flames reported the situation. This ended up finding it way back to my family, I have never really been close to them as we never got along, they started to make jokes about it and made fun of the fact. I felt like I had no one to turn to and it only made everything I was going through worse. After talking to a friend I blocked my family, its been 2 weeks after the fact now and I don't know if it was the right choice because it is my family but why would you make jokes loke that about someone you love. I don't know I'm just lost"

I’m sure you’re aware of ice spice, a female rapper that rose to fame in late 2022. around the begining of 2023 was when i started noticing my boyfriend acting really secretive. it started when i was on his phone and opened up instagram and he took the phone and changed the subject. the first time i brushed it off but that was really when i started to notice him “change”. first he showed me this new female artist named ice spice. he showed me her munch music video and told me i should dye my curly hair orange. i just laughed and thought it was a joke until i saw multiple pictures of me in his camera roll that were edited with orange curly hair. i asked him what it was and he told me it was a joke with his friends which only made me more mad. then one day he turned on his computer while i was laying in his bed and his screensaver was ice spice doing her signature pose. he laughed and said it was just a joke and changed it but when he switched windows, his youtube was open to an ice spice music video. multiple times while we were making love he would ask me to do the ice spice dance, or he would play her music, i drew the line when one time we were doing it and i looked over to see him, looking at his phone at a picture of ice spice. i was furious. a couple of weeks later me and my whole family had planned a trip to Aruba. initially he was going to come, but i decided to ask one of my my friends from high school instead because i thought a break from him would be nice. during the whole two week long trip he didn’t text me once. i always caved and texted him first. when i was on the way back he said he missed me so much and the next day after i returned i went to his house. he was in his kitchen getting food and i thought this was the perfect time to find answers if he was cheating on me. to be honest i would have feather found out he was cheating on me. in his closet i found an ice spice poster and a curly orange wig and green tube top. on his phone i went to his instagram dms and found he had texted ice spice every single day, responding to all of the stories with heart eyes and telling her how he would leave his girlfriend for her and how he thought they were ment to be together. i wasn’t as mad as i thought i would be, i think it was because it was just sad that he was so desperate for this girl who didn’t know him. but what i found next was horrifying. in his camera roll was hundreds of pictures of ice spice along with pictures of him dressed up as her. i confronted him immediately and left his house. we haven’t spoken since and i’m pretty sure we’ve both blocked each other on everything by now."

I, (13F) had a friend (13F) in middle school who would later start bullying me in other to appear likable to the popular mean girls clique. At that time I was 11 and a bit chubby. Not overweight, just a little rounder. Wasn't a danger to my health and really just my natural shape being a bit like those ancient Greek statues. I did not have a problem with my figure as I was normal weight-about bmi 20-21. However, my stick-skinny 21kg ex-bestie sure did. She and her newfound clique used to pick on me especially when I wore skinny jeans or tight tops. Fast forward 2 years and I have developed anorexia and bulimia. That led to me being really slim and now that I'm trying to recover and put weight on I'm a stereotypically beautiful type of slim. I also went to study in Turkey for high school and I hadn't heard from her at all. That was until a few days earlier when my school shared a photograph on their Instagram where the whole class is on.\nThe first thing I noticed is that she - always in the middle like usual as she's an attention seeker to an extreme level and will literally throw a tantrum if she is not always the center of attention - is visibly fatter. I mean sure, she had horrible eating habits like devouring 2 bags of chips and 1 bag of candy every day in addition to 3-4 full meals, but I'm embarrassed to admit I squealed with happiness as I saw her sitting there looking like a barrel of seal grease with s typical ugly makeup look that was giving somewhere in between a failed drag queen makeup look and an usual case of pre-shower makeup.\nAnyways, I'm doing better and am in recovery and she's built like Embarrassment from the new Inside Out 2 trailer and because of that I'm happier than ever."

        "text": "So my boyfriend (19m) and myself (20f) are currently recently engaged and have had a super happy life as of for the past 4 years and now currently have one beautiful baby girl who is the light of our lives. Despite everything we had been through, we’ve always been happy with each other. And to give a bit of background, him and I have been best friends since we were only 11 and 12 and have been super close since. I would like to address that we had also dated on and off while in junior high but we had decided to test the waters with other people. But as we got older and Highschool had hit, we both made an agreement that we would dedicate solely to each other in a relationship. Anyways, as the years went by, we both remember one of his ex’s. I won’t say her name but we’ll call her X. Now here is the thing about X… She hasn’t exactly been the most sane people in our lives but we had both dated her at least once in our lives. She was a short, busty, pixie cut blonde blue eyed white girl… With toman catholic parents. Now keep in mind. Both me and my partner are what you would call “coloured”. Now we don’t usually talk about our race but we are very cultural people and her parents never liked either of us. Due to their belief system and how their brains worked, they thought of both of us and “lower than human”. To which they were very clear about. Because of this, I believe they might be also playing a part in what their daughter had done. So as I mentioned in the start, my partner and I have a beautiful baby girl. As she was younger, my partner and I were very content and used to live going to our local mall. Now the one detail we began to notice is that one of the shops that were in this mall, was a store that X works in. Whenever we would go, we would notice her retreat to the back room to hide or she would begin to glare and stare us down while talking to her co-workers. We never paid any mind because even if we did, it wouldn’t matter. She was no longer part of our lives. Until she was. Not so many weeks after she had first witnessed us with our new baby daughter, we had received a call from an officer accusing my partner of sexual assault. We will call this officer M. Now with M, he had disclosed that there was a call recently made of accusing him of assault during junior high to which M had mentioned X’s name. To which this shocked us both. We both then knew what this had to be about. Now what I will mention is that when my partner and I weren’t dating, he had started a relationship with X. X didn’t like me. In fact she had used to spread false rumours about me around the school saying I slept with everyone and that I was a dirty person. She had used to be super jealous of me and would tend to try to corner me a lot, accusing me of trying to date her boyfriend (my now partner). As I used to tell her all the time, I never wanted him and plus, I was already currently in a relationship with someone else. Now I will say, I am against cheaters anyways. I find them distrusting. Anyways, X had such a strong jealously that she used to try to make everything a competition of who got to take what from my partner first… (examples are like first kiss, first love, and even virginity… sucks to suck though because I got all of that lol. But my partner never told her any of this). So after these arguments, I used to get so frustrated that I would tend to avoid my now current partner then. But we learned to then move past that as I was a grade ahead. So once I move schools, things seemed to quiet down and I still tested the waters but they never worked out. Until I transferred again due to career choice. So I ended meeting my partner in Highschool once again and we became friends again. But as he was still dating X, I told him I wanted to respect his relationship and I wanted him to be clear that I would never overstep that boundary. Unfortunately, X had gotten ahold of his situation and learned that we had guitar class together and hung out here and there. Which I’m turned caused many arguments to which my partner would try to calm her down and sort things out. (Keep in mind my partner has always be shy, kind, funny and a very insecure guy at times. He was very self conscious and used to get embarrassed with himself. He was also very suicidal and tended to keep quiet all the time. He used to be insecure of his figure ((being skinny as he was and fit)) he hated when people complimented him because he never believed them.) but she always in turn used to yell or start fights with him. To which some days he would stay home “sick”. Until one day she was so frustrated that she nearly broke up with him to which he distanced from me. But I never protested. In fact I encouraged it… But as months went by he came around again and I had learned they had broken up. So me being his closest friend, I helped him out. And as he healed and began to flourish, I began to see his scars healing as well. Both his physical and mental ones. Until once he was healed, he asked me out one day. And I said yes. And since then he’s been the best thing in my life. Now only is he respectful, but he’s been sweet, understanding, he always wants to sort our differences and he loves me through every milestone I go through. (Get this, he’s even amazing in bed!!! He actually takes care of me first so WHOOO! Lucky me:)). And he even got in the water with me when I gave birth to our baby girl. So now back to the present day, we are now hearing that she had made the report but with zero evidence but expect hear say. My partner is worried that the justice system will fail him. I’ve told him that since she’s only said he did it with no evidence he will be okay but he still worries. So now I’m worrying as well but I’m trying to look for the hood in this. But as of now, we have to wait and my mind is racing because I know how our justice system messes with our coloured people. So as of now, we’re waiting for a date for him to go in and make his statement. So I’m hoping for a bright side… I know for a fact that this man couldn’t hurt a fly because even if he accidentally taps me, he always asks if I’m okay. So please Reddit, wish me and my partner luck. Let’s hope the justice system rules this out and drops his case. I know X, and I know she’s vendictive so I hope that once she’s proven to have lied that we can sue her and teach her lesson. Wish us luck please! I’ll update if I can.\nEdit: I apologize for the spelling errors. If you have any questions, please ask!"

I didn't want to pursue it because of our different religions, our families won't agree to us getting married. But he said that we should still see where it goes and I genuinely like him a lot so we started dating.\nNow, he moved to Canada 10 months back and I am in India. While he was doing great here, he has not been able to find a job there and it is affecting our relationship.\nHe was this extremely loving and attentive guy here but not now. Now if I tell him I am sick he won't even ask what happened. We just talk for a few minutes whenever we can otherwise nothing. He also has this habit to ghost me every time things go south. For example two of his friends committed suicide and he stopped talking to me for 20 days. He could not crack n interview so we didn't talk for 10 days etc. We rarely talk on calls cuz he says the soundproofing is bad. And whenever he calls is when his roomies are gone and he wants to have phone sex. I once brought this up n he said that is what his love language is and he knows I am more into small gestures. I can't be physically stimulated if I feel emotionally detached. But nothing changed.\nBefore him I was with an abusive guy for 6 years and it has given me a lot of trust issues. He knows this and now, him not talking to me enough, ghosting me and the fact that we have only met once so far really bothers me. We have known each other for only 15 months and he has changed so drastically that I don't even know what side of him to believe anymore.\nI recently sent him a reel of a song in my native language that he does not understand and it was captioned.. \"don't say I love you to your Gujarati (my community) gf.. instead sing this.\" He replied with I can't too difficult, lol. I asked him if he can't even bother to ask the meaning. It hurt cuz it felt like he doesn't care. I know it's a small thing but it has been piling up for me and we eneded up fighting.\nI don't even know if my concerns are valid because he is in a different country, trying to find a livelihood with tight finances and lot of stress. I mostly try to keep things to myself but these lil things bother me a lot. My insecurities and trust issues surfacing, I don't even know if I am being selfish by fighting with him for this.His behavior at times does feel like red flags to me. But given his situation, I sometimes feel like if I need to be more understanding and put my past relationship traumas aside see him for himself? But then on other days, it just feels unfair to myself.\nOn the other hand, since I know us getting married has a very very low possibility, I feel like it is not right for me to demand from him to give me more time or whatever. And I also don't feel it right to leave him when he is low.\nBut then I don't understand how hard it is to step out of the house to talk for 5 mins once a while? Or just ask me how I am doing? Or if I text something romantic why can't he take 5.minutes to indulge me SOMETIMES if not always."

I'd practise my musical instruments at home and she would just walk in on me with washing as an excuse to be in there, the critique my abilities to play music, on an instrument she had 0 experience with. She would ask the teachers daily if I was behaving and performing well in school. Always invading and sort of privacy I had. And even though I was one of the smartest students in my year, she always told me \"you can do better\". Even though I was basically an A student in most subjects. She even made a fuss when I was put in top set english, and got me sent down a group because she didn't think I deserved it and made the other teacher cry for having to be involved. And all I'd asked her was to not interrupt my studies. If I needed help, I'd have asked. But she did not listen. And I suffered the consequences. I ended up in an isolation house almost all the time by the time I was in Yr 11. I couldn't stand the people I was surrounded by (my peers) and I was sick of being monitored 24/7. She was at my school. She dragged me to musical activities and had to be with me at all times. She was at home. I couldn't have friends around. Not because my parents were stricken. But because no one wanted to go to a teachers house because \"it was weird\". The worst part for my school life was the fact, for 1 year, she taught the class that involved \"sx ed\". And you guessed it, I was in that class. And then, in the next class period, when she returned to her normal subject, English, she told another member of staff, she \"had sx (ed)\" with a boy in my class. And everyone proceeded to tell me about it. EVERYONE.\nThis woman, literally shadowed my every step. And denied any issue with me. As a consequence, I grew up, started taking dr**s, drinking heavily, had several mental break downs, once landing me in a ward. And yes, I chose to do those things, because, like I say, no one knew me for me. So I tried to do everything possible to be anything but my mum. She took away my identity. And it wasn't just with school. Because she barely let me talk, she would steam roll.me in every conversation. One important conversation I had with her, was when I came out as bi. She laughed at me and told me \"I wasn't on her gaydar. So I couldn't be bi\". This broke me. She boiled me down to a spineless, out of control adult. I tried expressing to people what she was doing to me, and they all told me \"she was just trying for you\". But they didn't know she'd through bags at me if I didn't clean my room to her standard. One time, she ran out of the house on me and my dad when I was 9 because of a messy room. She blamed me for leaving the house. She blamed me for making her sound like a bad person. She made me miserable. I just became a dark, twisted, bitter little girl that never got the chance to figure out who she was. I tried to keep her happy. I tried to behave. I tried in school. But to my face, it was never good enough. To anyone else, I was the golden child who was so successful. Until, I turned 18.\nI left for university. I had no intention on going to uni. But it became my only option to get away from her. I remember feeling nothing when she cried as she left me at uni. And I was finally happy to be rid of her. But, I had to become an adult. And the truth is, the time I was supposed to be learning how to become one, she had me focused on a career, that never came to be. She wanted me to be a musician, and pushed everything for it to happen. And I think I like music. But she took the fun and enjoyment out of it. So I'm not 100% sure if I do, or if it was just for her.\nThere's alot more to add to this, but idk if I can bare writing everything she did. Just know, that because she emotionally @b*sed me, manipulated me and shaped me, I grew up to have 0 self confidence. This lead to me choosing awful partners, and a few of those partners, physically hurt me. And I let them, because I thought I deserved it, for never being good enough. She d!ed a year ago. I was sad for 2 days, but ever since, I've just felt relieved. But also, lost. I have no idea, who I am as a person. Idk what I want to do in life. I have 0 motivation to do anything exceptional in life. I just want a quiet life. Away from the world.\nIf you read this much, thanks. I've never been able to talk about my side of the story. And just wanted to get it off my chest, but to warn parents aswell. You cannot be that involed in your child's life. You have to let them grow on their own. And ffs, don't bully your children. If you care, even just a little, you would be ashamed of yourself. Children aren't trophies. Let them be kids. Don't take childhood away for a potential career. Help them discover themselves. Thanks for reading. And sorry if its messy. I have ADHD and keep forgetting what I've already written, but can't go back and re read everything I've put lol."

So this kid in my class, lets call him B, B threw the ruler at my face on purpose, and started laughing to all his freinds becase everyone saw. So i quickly took the ruler and just tried to ignor it but later that day , B whsiped to his friends \"that girl over there? Shes got Gyatt' and I felt very uncomfortable, as he looked at me while licking his lips. I just went to class, and i put my hoodie over my skirt, but later that day when he tried grabbing me when i was at my locker, he said \" youre hot. I wish i could just r*pe you.\" And i kicked him, as hard as i could in the balls. Then B started crying like a little kid. He said he needed to go to the hospital, he got driven there for a checkup. Nothing serious, but he'd be sore for a week, and in pain for that time. I had to go to the principals office right after, and guess what? B started playing the victim. He said id assulted him and kicked him when he was just trying to talk to me. The principal didnt hear me out when i tried to explain and he said \"he proably likes you. Youre a nice young lady maybe he was asking you out.\" And i almsot screamed. i dont know if the princpal belived me or B, but he said to me if i ever tried that again on B he'd kick me oit of his school, and that i need to mind B's space. He called my dad and i was suspended for three days, when he dad came to pick me up from work, he yelled the the principal saying stiff like \"You're kid is an animal! Lock him up my daughter was obviously scared shes just defeding herself! Is she just supposted to take that?\" The principal said \"boys will be boys. Your daughter should just be more mindful of what he might be feeling.\" And sent me and my dad out. My dad was still pissed, but he took me out for ice cream. Saying i did the right thing and that he could never be more proud of me."

        "text": "My (16) girlfriend who is 16 is getting in an arranged marriage. I dont know what to do. We started talking a couple of months back and started loving eachother. We started dating and we promised to get married. She is a very good girl who has a good job and studies psychology. She was going to her home country for the first time in her life apparently for her older uncle who is getting married. Her father payed for everything in the wedding and told her it was tradition to pay for a siblings marriage. She was very excited and I was excited for her aswell. She got a dress from her father and asked for who it was. Her father got mad at her for asking for who it was and told her everything. She is getting married to her family member and the reason her father payed for the wedding was because it is her wedding… After she got the news she called me on the phone and started crying very badly. Shocked is nothing compared to hate I was. I don’t know if she is getting married to her uncle who is pretty old or an older cousin but it breaks my heart that I can’t do anything about it. She is getting married in April. I talked with my brother and my friend who is like an older brother to me and they both told me to call the police because it’s not allowed to arrange a marriage without the brides permission. My friends told me to ‘kidnap’ her (with her permission of course) I havent been in contact with her since she called me. Please someone help me. I am in pain. For those of you wondering I live in belgium and I don’t know what the laws are about kidnapping her with her permission. As I said she is 16 so she is underage. Help me please I want to help her."

        "text": "I had a group of friends who didn't really care about me personally and used me as an emotional baggage carrier. Told me about every one of their problems instead of the school counselors or a teacher, relied on me extensively as a therapist, and never took notice of my obvious discomfort. All of this while never including/inviting me to anything. It took a negative toll on my mental health and I think I was depressed, badly. I didn't realize what was happening until I told my mom how bad I felt for getting uncomfortable. Like, it wasn't my unresolved trauma! What right did I have to feel like that? According to Mom, every right.\nIn that 45-minute car ride, she taught me more about setting emotional boundaries than I knew I could have. I respected my friends' boundaries religiously, but I didn't set any of my own. I started enforcing them, not very well, but I did. After about half a month, I was ready to leave, but the main one who treated me like this, we'll call her Heinz, a close family friend of hers died. I helped her to the counselor's office and sat with her. Of course, I kept being dragged back with issues and drama I \"needed\" to resolve. Finally, a month later, Heinz had to move. She wouldn't have her phone to contact us because she got it taken away.\nI escaped the friend group shortly afterward without anyone noticing. How, may you ask? A kid in that friend group we'll call Alex. Alex was friends with this group of band and theater kids. He introduced me to them and I spent more and more time with them, eventually leading to a lack of interaction with any of the others in the previous friend group.\nIt wasn't until the next school year that I realized just what I went through. I was 11-12 in 7th grade when it started(I skipped a grade and I have a late birthday), 12 in 8th grade when I started trying to leave, and 13 in 8th when I got out. I skipped freshman year too, and went to a prestigious boarding school in STEM. It wasn't until then, sophomore year, that I realized just what I went through. What concerned me the most though, is what I had blocked out.\nHeinz would hit me. Hard enough to leave bruises AS A JOKE. I was so uncomfortable and new to friendships that required work that I just went with it. I immediately called my mom and told her. She was shocked and upset. I went to the school counselor and talked. She was equally concerned. One of my friends said it was abusive.\nI will be looking into getting help to resolve my issues with what I'm guessing is mild depression, anxiety, and whatever it's called when you're insecure about annoying your friends and you hate yourself anytime you talk too long. I was not like that before they got to me.\nHeinz, if you're reading this, you know exactly who you are. Get help, and never treat anyone remotely similar to how you treated me, because if you do, I hope you get exactly what you deserve."

I was scrolling in her instagram reel untill I saw a notification with my name in the text. I was hesitant to open it but I was curious why my name was in a conversation with her friend. (Mind you this is her online friend) so I decided to open it and scroll up to where they started talking about me and I saw messages that I didn’t like between them. Her friend Amy mentioned about our relationship and my girlfriend Mary told her that it was okay but I was really annoying. I saw that her friend said that she could do better, and find someone els better looking l. Obviously this made me feel some type of was because I do everything and anything for her she is my happiness. I felt like I was doing everything right. I confronted her about it and she got really defensive and mad that I was reading their conversation. She didn’t even acknowledge that I was clearly upset, she continued to argue with me and yell at me. We had a really big argument and I just decided to leave and give her alone time, when I came back she was better so I asked her if we could talk about what happend. She said “there’s nothing to talk about” i kept insisting but she wouldn’t budge. I gave up and eventually went home, I did not want her friend Amy to convince her that she could do better. I mean she could but no one’s perfect. I just didn’t want her to ruin our relationship, so the next day I told her I don’t want her being friends with Amy no more. I know this sounds controlling but she’s my girlfriend and I’m her boyfriend Amy is just an online friend she met not to long ago. But she got defensive again and said no. I kept insisting but it wouldn’t budge. I got annoyed and said “ me or her you pick” she said she doesn’t know. At this point I was so out of it. I gave it a couple days and asked again just to make sure she didn’t say anything out of spite. She still gave me the same answer, untill I cried infront of her she said she will stop being friends with her. I believed her, a couple weeks went by and it was better or so I thought. She began talking to me less, I knew it had to be Amy so I went on her phone and looked through her messages and boom there was Amy’s contacts . My girlfriend never stopped talking to her. I saw the messages she said “ I made him cry, I felt bad but he was annoying” and this really hurt because she was the only one I truly trusted with my feelings and she went and told her friend about everything. Talking crap about me behind my back ect. I don’t know what to do what should I do?"

        "text": "I, (13F) have been friends with Sandra (11F) for a while now. At first glance you might think that she's still young and that's why she's lying but I firmly believe that's not what it is. Sandra is a very nice and polite girl, especially for her age, since most of the 11-year olds nowadays are complete morons. However, she has a problem, I think. She is lying about at least half of the things she talks about. The first red flag was when I first got to know her. I was 12 at the time but she was still 11. This was around July last year. She started hanging out with me a lot and while I didn't want to be her friend I still became her friend because she didn't have many herself. First she told me that she was 13 already and I did not believe it at all because she looked 10 at best and also she had just turned 11 but at the time I did not know that. I thought that maybe there's a slim chance that she just looks younger because she is short and built like Eric Cartman. Right now I'm praying that she doesn't find this post because I'm about to speak about everything she has lied about and boy does she not like that. Somehow we started texting and she started sending me those \"send this to your bff\" videos which was kinda weird because again, we had just started texting. The next thing I noticed being off was that she lied about being half Spanish yet not speaking any and on her retarded TikTok account she only put clearly google-translated text in her videos. Also, when she was speaking I could hear a thick estonian accent which was also odd because she claimed to not speak Estonian at all. I myself am half Estonian so I known Estonian really well. With the letters ö, ä, ü, ä which are found in the Estonian alphabet, she did a weird accent-thingy to signal that she can't speak Estonian. Even though the letter ü appears in Spanish. She claimed to go to Spain too much, like, every month which wouldn't be possible, really. She also went to school in Estonia which she possibly wouldn't have done if she lived mostly in Spain. Now, how did I find evidence that she's lying? At this point it was still purely a hypothesis that she was lying although it was pretty clear she was lying. I needed to prove for myself that she is clearly a liar. Evidence on the not-knowing-a-squat-of-estonian being false is that 1)she had a thick accent when speaking English 2)she told me that she was \"learning Estonian\" and 3 months later KABOOM she's fluent and also uses slang frequently. In what universe is that possible? The evidence on her not being Spanish is 1)she \"went to Spain\" too frequently-one moment she's telling me how much she loves it in Spain and the other moment when she needed to make a video with her friend she is immediately back in Estonia? Not even a plane video, not a message, just \"oh did you see my TikTok I'm back in Estonia\" honey that's not true and that's a crappy lie by the way. The evidence on her not being 13 is quite simple actually I stalked her socials because that's what you do if you want to find out stuff and I found an old video where her classmate commented about them being in the 4th grade. I looked at the date and it was posted on the previous school year-4th graders are 10 in Estonia, that would make her 11 now. Also, now that I think about it it's weird that she wants to be my friend because she's the youngest friend I have now-she's a first-year in middle school and I'm a first-year in high school (in Turkey 8th grade is first year of high school) but eh it might just seem weird tho.\nThe problem is that recently she has been showing signs of anorexia. At first I took that so so seriously as I happen to struggle with it myself and she really is quite Caseoh-shaped so the bullying she experiences at school might've got to her. When I confronted her about that she told me that she had already lost \"a lot\" which she told me was 44kg to 39kg. Now 5kg really isn't a lot in 2 months but if lost unhealthily then it could still be a problem. However when she posted a what I eat in a day I counted the calories and it gave a healthy-for-her-age number and when I found out her height and calculated her bmi I once again, didn't know if to believe her-it gave me a number of 16. It was odd because beforehand she had told me that her bmi was 17 and it wasn't that. Also, she is by no means a bmi almost-underweight. She is very plump. Meanwhile being fat is not bad if you want to be then why not, but why lie? My friends with ed's suspect her to be a bmi 24-26 which is overweight and I believe that is her bmi as well. I'd say she might've subtracted 10kgs off her weight because she knows I'm very slender and maybe she was afraid I might judge her, I mean, sure, I am 20cm taller and about 5kg lighter than I suspect her to be but I would not comment on her weight as it does not invalidate an individual's eating disorder. Now I don't even know if I should believe that she has an ed because she claims to barely eat at all when texting, although in her WIEIAD's she eats a healthy amount of calories (and in captions she even claims that this was not all she had) and also she only claimed these symptoms for a month and then stopped with it completely which she does with many of her casual lies so I am speculating if maybe she isn't struggling with that at all and I pray that she just said that as a lie or a cry for attention because I don't want her to have an ed, however, this may not be a lie at all.\nWhat should I do? Keep in mind I am in another country at the moment so the only way I can contact her is via phone. And is she lying?"

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying. I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this."

        "text": "I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\nGiven that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\nThey’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\nThe internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\nEdit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”"

My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all.\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)"

        "text": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a 1967 Impala 4 door that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice! SHES GONNA BE ALRIGHT"

Before then, I brought all the advice I received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how I was feeling and what I should do.\nMy sponsor was straight with me and told me that I would be putting myself in danger by going and that I should do something else that day to grieve.\nWhen Thursday rolled around, I was a mess.

Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too. So he was just like \"OP, this is unacceptable, you're fired.\"\nI started acting real sad, like \"no please don't fire me, my family needs the money, I need this job, pleaseeee\" and he played up being a hard-ass, telling me to take off my apron and leave.\nThe angry guy started to backtrack, like \"It isn't that big of a problem, you don't need to fire her over it. I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us. And almost every time, the person who had come in angry will apologise and say that they didn't mean it. It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\nAITA for this joke?"

I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation.\nMy fiancee is completing her residency. We live together and have for a few years now. We aren't in any hurry to get married. We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.\nIt is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin. I don't really care. I'm an adult and I do what I want. We are getting married in June.\nSo we are visiting my parents for Christmas.

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit.

While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults.\nWhen we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults.\nEncouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society.

So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver.\nThat night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal.

I just couldn't continue with this argument. I told him I needed space and that I would be going to stay with my sister for a while. He didn't take it well, he literally got up from the couch and opened the door telling me to go right then. In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time. His mom can do no wrong. I'm always the aggressive, crazy, jealous, pathetic, overreactor.\nAll these people's opinions, advice and concerns were like a spark...like the wake up call I really needed. Though I wish that it didn't get this far but what's done is done.\nRight now I'm staying with my sister (I brought my dog with me as well) He sent me his last message telling I'm the one choosing to end what we had together but I believe it's the other way around, especially with how he keeps making his mom the victim in this situation. It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm not mad at him and don't expect him to change but...at least I'm given options to decide what's best for me and my future even if it's seperation and divorce.\nA big thank you to those who reached out with resources that I feel very very lucky to have come across. Just wanted to give you an update since many of you asked for it."

        "text": "Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I’m struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one.\nWe’ve always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan.\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan.\nThat wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.\nfrankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house."

        "text": "I was asked for an update on r/AmItheAsshole/comments/g31n1q/wibta_for_planting_prickly_bushes_in_my_front/\nAbout a week after my post I planted a 'wall' of blackberries and raspberries at the 2 sides of my garden facing the driveway, about 30 cm from the edge so no overhanging branches! On the other side of the berry wall I planted lots stuff like strawberries and tomatoes. To reach the tomatoes and strawberries from the driveway you have either go through the fruitbushes or walk up to my house, walk about 2m along the side of the house and my windows and then walk into my actual garden. Not something you do by mistake.\nFor about 2 weeks it was somewhat quiet but I still found the kids on my driveway every single days. As far as I know they did not enter the garden and I hadn't noticed them walking around my house anymore, so I figured the bushes were working.\nAbout 1 week ago berry season started and my bushes are now full of raspberries and there's lots of strawberries as well. The neighbours noticed. First I caught the boys picking and eating raspberries so I told them off and dropped them off at home, told their mom I caught them stealing (that's how I see it even though it's fruit) and that I'd call the cops next time. She huffed and told me to grow up, but took the boys inside anyway.\nAfter that it was quiet up until yesterday afternoon, when I went out for a while and found the dad and his 2 sons right in the middle of my garden when I returned, clearing my bushes and plants. I didn't even confront them, just called the cops from a distance as they hadn't noticed me yet and started filming them after making the call. Luckily 2 cops showed up after 10 minutes or so and they confronted the neighbour as they were still picking berries. They told them they were trespassing and that the berry picking was in fact considered stealing and that I could press charges. For the first time I noticed a bit of fear in my neighbour, he was having trouble finding his words and kept looking back at his house (I guess hoping his wife would show to yell at the cops). They all went inside with the cops, so I just went home as well.\nAfter a while the cops came by and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked them if they felt like they scared the neighbour enough to stay away. I got a small smile and yes about him, but the wife had just kept shouting at them and her husband about the 'little bitch' living next door. I told them no for now, asked them if I'd be allowed to get an extra camera set up on the wall between my garden and the road to cover the entire front garden + driveway, they said that's allowed as long as it's on my side of the wall.\nSo, now I'm getting an extra camera installed, one neighbour knows I'm done messing around but his wife isn't there yet and if I ever catch any of them again, the cops will be called and possible charges will follow."

With like a lot of emphasis on the last word.\nI was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like \"Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls\"\nHe was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said \"you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it\"\nI just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying \"what's for dinner tonight b*tch\" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok.\nI thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the \"joke\", it was still disrespectful.\nBut it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate.\nThe next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.\n\"Yeah so that's the btch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this btch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night\"\nHe called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up.\nI told him \"yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch\"\nHe told me he didn't and it was just a \"trend\" and I got pissed off he was playing that \"TikTok trend\" BS excuse again and I told him \"Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!\"\nHe got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us\nAITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me \"what's for dinner tonight, b*tch\"\nEdit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:\n\"But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?\"\nHonestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help.\nThis isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like \"Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)\"\nAnd if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD. NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO NOT \"UNDERSTAND\""

Dad left money (inheritance) for me and sister and she used her inhertance to get new cars and renovate her house I live with my aunt right now cause my brother inlaw didn't let me stay with my sister. I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet).\nMy sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral. only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior. I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future.\nI refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father. My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.\nShe's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school."

My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come.

He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say \"FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her\".\nThings got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible.

She admitted that she knows I'm not sexist, or \"ableist\" (IDK if I spelled that right, there's a red line under it), and explained that she was lashing out due to her mental state.\nI accepted her apology, and offered one of my own. Both for giving her too much responsibility too quickly, and also for reacting out of emotion.\nShe explained to me that she had a major issue on Monday, and without getting into too much detail, I'll just say that it was the anniversary of a bad thing.\nShe's taking all of her accumulated PTO (~9 weeks), and we've agreed that going forward, I'm not going to put her on the schedule on that day ever again.\nShe's admitted that she's not up to the role of manager. When she returns, she will be in the role of lead cashier, a role I created specifically for her. This way she can keep her raise, and not feel like she got a \"demotion\", but rather a lateral transfer. I've also let her know that if she ever feels like she's up to more responsibility, she can let me know, and I'll put her right back on track for the manager spot.\nI've also let her know that if she's ever in a position where she's not able to call out, she can simply text me a thumbs down emoji, and I will accept that as notice that she will be missing her next shift. She's agreed that that will be ok, even when she's \"out of spoons\".\nI appreciate all of the ~6000 comments my post got, even the ones calling me TA. Thank you all very much. I want to specifically address the folks who explained \"spoon theory\" to me, as well as those who commented about \"peter principle\", those two types of comments very heavily influenced my actions.

I've been patient for my wife and side stepping those comments, saying things like \"Thanks, but I think I'll stick to the way I do it.\"\nThings came to a head two weeks ago when my wife, FIL, MIL, and I were in her parent's kitchen prepping dinner for my MIL's birthday. We were running a bit behind so things were heated (which I kind of like because it reminded me of work) and that's when Sarah walked in. She took one look at what I was doing, scoffed, and said something like \"Oh wow, okay, so that's not the right way of doing things\". It hit a nerve and I pretty sternly told her to stop criticizing my cooking and that I'm also a chef like her. She laughed and said \"making Kung Pao chicken at some Chinese restaurant doesn't count\". The kitchen went silent, FIL snorted/chuckled, and my MIL yelled \"SARAH WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU\". I stopped what I was doing, swore at her and called her \"a racist piece of shit\", apologized to my MIL for not being able to stay, and left for home with my wife.\nApparently this caused a massive fight after we left, with my MIL/BIL/other SIL taking my side and my FIL/Sarah saying \"it was a joke but kind of true\" and that I was \"being too sensitive\". The extended family somehow got wind of this and now everyone is arguing and taking sides, with my wife even getting texts from some her cousins apologizing for Sarah's behavior. Despite being on my side, my wife is begging me to apologize so that the fighting will stop but I refuse to because fuck Sarah and her blatant racism.\nAITA?\nTL;DR: I'm a chef working at upscale Chinese resto, my SIL is a chef at upscale French resto. She's critical of my cooking skills and has now called it \"making Kung Pao chicken at a Chinese restaurant\". Family at war, wife begging me to apologize, what do?\nEDIT: My wife has also informed me that now Sarah may be in trouble at work and she's blaming me for it. Apparently one of her co-workers heard her rant about what happened and reported it to management. (Edit: To clarify Sarah is blaming me, though my wife is partly blaming me)\nEDIT2/UPDATE: So it looks like one of my wife's cousins found this post and put it on Sarah's Facebook wall going \"This is you right?...\". Her FB friends are starting to comment with things like \"If this is you Sarah then I'm disappointed\". I think Sarah's still at work - shit might be hitting the fan soon and now my wife is pissed too. Will try to update but might have to delete post if things go nuclear\nEDIT3/UPDATE2: Was considering removing but I just got a voicemail from my FIL that \"[my] presence was only being tolerated up until this point\" and threatened a \"world of hurt\" if I didn't delete this post. Officially going to keep this post up and if you're still reading this Doug - I'm very disappointed in you, you're better than this. Will also continue to update and thanks again for all your support folks\nEDIT4/UPDATE3: Lots of stuff just went down\nMy wife got a call from SIL. (From wife's paraphrasing) Sarah started screaming/crying at her the moment my wife picked up and said that she just got demoted because of \"[her] {Asian slur} husband\". Apparently some of her co-workers have her on FB and showed the post to management, which combined with her earlier rant, double whammied her back to being a line cook and now she might get fired. My wife told her to go fuck herself and is now solidly on my side after taking the verbal abuse from Sarah and reading some of the comments here. My wife is still the opposite of happy though...\nWife called MIL and asked her WTF was going on with FIL. MIL was confused so my wife played back the voicemail I had on my phone and apparently my MIL literally just walked away from the phone without hanging up and started screaming at FIL.\nFacebook post has now devolved into a clusterfuck flame war with family and friends jumping in.\nSuffice to say, it has officialy gone nuclear\nMe right now\nI think I'm going to have to call this a day, will make an update post when the dust settles. Thanks again folks\nEDIT5/UPDATE4:\nTurns out I'm not allowed to post an update post for some reason:\nNo, you provided all your updates in the original post with your many, many edits. You can edit this in, but we will not be allowing a standalone update on this.\nI'd like to clarify that I got my wife and MIL's permissions to post this update (out respect for them and their privacy)\nSuffice to say, it's been kind of nuts this past week. My wife and I had to turn off social media for a bit because of the shitstorm caused by her cousin putting my last post on Sarah's Facebook page. Some people even tried to call the restaurant I work at to get me fired as retribution, but luckily everyone there is 100% on my side (or as my boss put it \"Fuck [Sarah], fuck those racists, fuck them so goddamn much\"). I guess it didn't help them that half the calls involved threats, screaming, and more racial slurs.\nWe didn't hear any updates from her family, even though we assumed the shit met fan after MIL found out about FIL's threatening voicemail (still disappointed in you Doug). But that changed on Sunday night, when MIL suddenly showed up at our door with overnight bags. After we took a moment to help unpack and calm down, she spilled the beans on everything.\nFIL (aka Doug)\nApparently my MIL and FIL were already having trouble in their marriage, and it was only made worse with a certain 2016 Presidential election (she's a Dem, and he had apparently gone more far-right since then). Seems that a line was crossed with the \"Kung Pao Incident\" and his voicemail. When he refused to apologize for anything (typical Doug), she asked for a divorce and he went beserk. She didn't feel safe there so that's when she came over (other BIL and SIL live out of town).\nExtended Family (aka The Great FB War of 2021)\nYou may have been able to tell already, but the extended family was largely arguing/fighting/divided along political lines for a few years now and my cousin's FB post was likely just the light to set off the powder keg. According to my MIL, the fallout has allegedly already led to some break-ups, excommunication of some family members, and even an argument that ended with police involvement. Haven't verified this myself though.\nSarah / SIL\nAccording to my MIL, Sarah came over to her place on Friday. The writing was on the wall and she was basically forced to quit. Despite her trying to start from scratch as a line cook, the entire staff turned against her. Nothing was coming back from the (dish) pit for her and she was getting the cold shoulder. She’s a great chef (I will admit this is true), but they took no chances since it turns out (shit you not)... they're partly owned by a Chinese investment company. Found this hard to believe and didn't want to add this detail, but it turned out to be true after some research (won't say any further for privacy). Word also got around in the local industry, and Sarah is essentially blacklisted from high-end establishments. She's now considering selling her home and moving to find work. As much as I don't like her and found her behavior horrifying, I didn't intend for this to happen so I've reached out to some buds in other states to see if they had any openings. Whether or not she wants to take itis up to her (and no, she has not apologized for anything either - but I still want to be a decent person to her).\nIt sure as hell doesn't feel like a happy ending. Perhaps bittersweet justice, but that's all I can give you. Thank you all for your support and for reading.\nStill me right now."

        "text": "My brother in-law (Sammy) lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\nOlivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.\nLast straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying. I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\nSammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\nI told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\nShe got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\nEveryone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this."

        "text": "I’ve enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I’ve noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.\nGiven that, I think it’s important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.\nSo just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.\nThey’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you don’t try to be involved in your child’s life, no matter how much support you pay. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you’re childfree. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They’ll think you’re an asshole if you can’t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\nThe internet has its own values, and that’s fine. But in the real world, people who can’t just go along to get along most of the time? People who don’t want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don’t seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.\nSo yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people’s opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub’s judgement of who’s the asshole in a given situation. I don’t know if the disparity is just because of reddit’s demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don’t want to get down voted to oblivion.\nSo even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you’re totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you’re an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they’re being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don’t technically “owe” anyone anything.\nOr maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.\nEdit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.\nEdit 2: I’ve never seen this movie, but it’s come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: “You’re not wrong Walter, you’re just an asshole”"

        "text": "I'm back like I said I would be,. My original post got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all.\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)"

        "text": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a 1967 Impala 4 door that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

Like how sad so your have to be to be a grown-ass man taking your anger out on high school and college kids.\nSo James and I were joking about having a little fun with them and hopefully getting them off our backs.\nSo one day I was at work and some guy was having a temper about how we don't make the coffee hot enough... Which I couldn't do a thing about because I gave it to him right out of the machine.\nSo James came in and was like \"sir is there a problem here\" and the guy started ranting at him too.

I didn't mean it\" and James was like \"No, we pride ourselves on the best customer service\"\nOf course after all that drama I still had my job, we were just acting. And we've done it a couple times, whenever a customer will lose their temper at Danielle or I, James will storm in and \"fire\" us.

It's kind of satisfying, making people realize their actions might actually have consequences.\nAnyway, I was telling my friends from school about this and a few of them thought it was a mean prank, to let someone go away thinking they'd gotten someone who desperately needs the money fired.\nAITA for this joke?"

We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.\nIt is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin. I don't really care. I'm an adult and I do what I want. We are getting married in June.\nSo we are visiting my parents for Christmas.

My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me.\nThe subject gets changed very fast. After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern. I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.\nMy parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and \"guide me\" into the afterlife. Not my thing though and I explained that I am not them, but their daughter who wanted to live her last weeks in peace, not the turmoil they were putting me through. And while a lot of people stated that funerals are for the living (true true), I firmly believe that a funeral is for the living to remember that person as WHO they were, not what anyone else wanted them to be. My parents seemed to understand when I told them that. They were not on board with the party favor aspect though, kind of a bummer. Pretty lucky to plan my own funeral, honestly. But, now that that is all said and done! Thank you, guys. I was blown away by the responses.I was moved to tears and I wish I had had the chance to meet every single one of you. You all be good now, ight? Take it one day at a time and fucking enjoy yourself! You only get one life, unless you're someone who has survived death than you're just a fucking hero and probably a cat with a few lives to spare. I love you all. I'm resting easy now. This disease sucks and I'm happy to be rid of it. And laugh and love and cry and be sad. Shit happens. I've got to go now, I'm gonna go snuggle my husband and my cats. Keep it real, Reddit. Love you, all!\""

        "text": "Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her mother, Jessica. Madeline’s father died before she was born.\nMadeline is currently 15, and she’s rebelling for almost everything. She did something bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said “You’re not my dad. I don’t have to follow you”. Honestly, I got a bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn’t mean it, and that she’d probably change. I just replied “I’m still your legal guardian for the next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.”\nThat happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping, when Madeline said “I’m hungry. I need food.” I decide to be extremely cheeky and say “Hi Hungry, I’m not your dad.” My son just started to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my wife was berating me “Not to stoop down to her level.”\nI honestly thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?\nEdit: I did adopt her. So legally I am her parent.\nMini Update: I’ll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter’s room after dinner and begin talking with her. “Hey. I’m really sorry that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And plus I’m legally your dad, so we’re stuck together. But seriously, I’m going to love you like my daughter even if you don’t think I’m your dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that’s good."

My reply was exactly how do you plan to “make up” my wedding? It’s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter.\nThen he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn’t have.\nAm I the A here.

My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).\nExtended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.\nEventually my sister got really fed up and said “Shut up, I’m not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin.” My brother hadn’t done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk.\nAnyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he’s a virgin and she didn’t say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn’t need to be made fun of like this.\nSo I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it’s not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn’t know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.\nFamily is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine."

        "text": "I’ve become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP’s to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults.\nWhen we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults.\nEncouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our “throw-away” consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don’t have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place.\nPlease think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts."

My son (13M) loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food.\nI told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver.\nThat night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal.

I have to admit that my husband's mom favors him over all his siblings. this affected his relationship with them and me as well. He's never seen an issue with how differently his mom treats him, it bothered me and made me feel uncomfortable. The whole dynamic made me feel uncomfortable. Going Low contact has never even been an option. Like he has to see her or call her everyday.\nMost of his siblings don't talk to him and I 100% believe it's because of his mom's favoritism like I said. He does bare some blame for not seeing how wrong this is til this day.\nIn many instances I found myself making excuses for his behavior. Even in my post. I did it spontaniously and I don't know why. But I guess it's because of how much I love him and because I really really wanted to be able to work things this type of things out without letting them affect our marriage.\nregarding what happened with the trip, He tried to have a talk with me and most of what he said came from place of blame, Blame towards me. I just couldn't continue with this argument. I told him I needed space and that I would be going to stay with my sister for a while. He didn't take it well, he literally got up from the couch and opened the door telling me to go right then. In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time. His mom can do no wrong. I'm always the aggressive, crazy, jealous, pathetic, overreactor.\nAll these people's opinions, advice and concerns were like a spark...like the wake up call I really needed. Though I wish that it didn't get this far but what's done is done.\nRight now I'm staying with my sister (I brought my dog with me as well) He sent me his last message telling I'm the one choosing to end what we had together but I believe it's the other way around, especially with how he keeps making his mom the victim in this situation. It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm not mad at him and don't expect him to change but...at least I'm given options to decide what's best for me and my future even if it's seperation and divorce.\nA big thank you to those who reached out with resources that I feel very very lucky to have come across.

This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc.\nNone of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I’m not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn’t mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it’s not YOUR pan.\nShe asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn’t want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they’re colored is so it helps me remember that I’m not to touch them unless I’m cooking vegan.\nThat wasn’t good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is ‘contaminated’ with animal product, and the fridge has ‘bacon grease fingers’ on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she’s asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don’t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it’s clearly enough that it upsets my daughter.\nfrankly I’m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife’s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn’t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it’s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I’m sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I’m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house."

On the other side of the berry wall I planted lots stuff like strawberries and tomatoes. To reach the tomatoes and strawberries from the driveway you have either go through the fruitbushes or walk up to my house, walk about 2m along the side of the house and my windows and then walk into my actual garden. Not something you do by mistake.\nFor about 2 weeks it was somewhat quiet but I still found the kids on my driveway every single days. As far as I know they did not enter the garden and I hadn't noticed them walking around my house anymore, so I figured the bushes were working.\nAbout 1 week ago berry season started and my bushes are now full of raspberries and there's lots of strawberries as well. The neighbours noticed. First I caught the boys picking and eating raspberries so I told them off and dropped them off at home, told their mom I caught them stealing (that's how I see it even though it's fruit) and that I'd call the cops next time. She huffed and told me to grow up, but took the boys inside anyway.\nAfter that it was quiet up until yesterday afternoon, when I went out for a while and found the dad and his 2 sons right in the middle of my garden when I returned, clearing my bushes and plants. I didn't even confront them, just called the cops from a distance as they hadn't noticed me yet and started filming them after making the call. Luckily 2 cops showed up after 10 minutes or so and they confronted the neighbour as they were still picking berries. They told them they were trespassing and that the berry picking was in fact considered stealing and that I could press charges. For the first time I noticed a bit of fear in my neighbour, he was having trouble finding his words and kept looking back at his house (I guess hoping his wife would show to yell at the cops). They all went inside with the cops, so I just went home as well.\nAfter a while the cops came by and asked me if I wanted to press charges. I asked them if they felt like they scared the neighbour enough to stay away. I got a small smile and yes about him, but the wife had just kept shouting at them and her husband about the 'little bitch' living next door. I told them no for now, asked them if I'd be allowed to get an extra camera set up on the wall between my garden and the road to cover the entire front garden + driveway, they said that's allowed as long as it's on my side of the wall.\nSo, now I'm getting an extra camera installed, one neighbour knows I'm done messing around but his wife isn't there yet and if I ever catch any of them again, the cops will be called and possible charges will follow."

Like how would he know otherwise?\"\nHonestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help.\nThis isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like \"Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)\"\nAnd if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms...

I'm planning on using my inhertance money to pay for college tuition (I've always wanted to be doctor but haven't decided which branch yet).\nMy sister & I haven't been close, it started after she got married to her chronically ill husband who was allowed to make backhanded comments about dad and mock his llness and make a scene at his funeral. only because he's ill and shouldn't be held accountable for his behavior. I've distanced myself But my sister kept visiting alot lately venting about my brother inlaws condition. He's been in & out the hospital for heart problems and in need for a surgery. She brought up my inheritance money several times but I end up cutting the conversation. She then straight up asked if I could help pay for her husband's surgery and she'd pay back in less than a year. I felt uneasy cause if I give her money from my inhertance which is a large amount then there's no gurantee she'll pay back before It's time to apply for college. I'm taking a year gap but I know my sister can't pay back that much and I felt I was risking my future.\nI refused to help and she had a melt down at my aunt's house calling me heartless, cruel with no empathy. She said that her husband's health should be a priority and I needed to help because education is nothing compared to someone's health and asked if I'd be happy to see her as a widow and my nephew with no father. My aunt suggested others pay but most of them cut my sister and her husband off. I argued that her husband's poor health isn't my fault after she kept blaming and guiltriping me. She kept crying and although my aunt decided to stay out of it she said that I should be prepared for permenant damage in my relationship with my sister if I don't help her now.\nShe's been sending texts and pictures of her family telling me this is what I was saying no to, a happy healthy family with a healthy husband and father. I cried and felt like I was being selfish not good aunt and sister. I asked my friend and he said let them sell the cars and all the luxurious stuff they bought to afford the surgery and warned me if I give them money I'll never get it back and may not be able to go to medical school."

He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there \"anyway\" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.\nI went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.\nDid I really overreact?"

        "text": "So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his \"observations\" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say \"oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though...\" or when he looks at my waist and says \"Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!\". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.\nWe went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said \"I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!\". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs \"SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!\". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an \"observation\" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.\nNow I feel like an absolute idiot asshole and like I ruined christmas for him and everybody with my over sensitivity. AITA??"
